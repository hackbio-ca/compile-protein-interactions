How to Access the Neo4j Python Project
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

Go to the GitHub repository link:

https://github.com/YourUsername/Neo4j-Bioinformatics


Click Code → Copy URL.

Open a terminal or PowerShell on your computer.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Neo4j-Bioinformatics.git


Change into the project directory:

cd Neo4j-Bioinformatics

2️⃣ Install Python Dependencies

Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed.

Install the Neo4j Python driver:

pip install neo4j~=5.28.0


Optional: If you use a .env file, install python-dotenv:

pip install python-dotenv

3️⃣ Set Up Neo4j Credentials

The project uses environment variables for security.

In PowerShell, set your Neo4j AuraDB credentials:

$env:NEO4J_URI="neo4j+s://<YOUR_INSTANCE>.databases.neo4j.io"
$env:NEO4J_USERNAME="<YOUR_USERNAME>"
$env:NEO4J_PASSWORD="<YOUR_PASSWORD>"


Important: Do not commit your credentials to GitHub.

4️⃣ Run the Python Script

Run the blank connection script to test connectivity:

python connections.py


Expected output:

Connection Successful!


Your Neo4j database is now ready and empty. You can start adding nodes and relationships.

5️⃣ Optional: Load Your Own Data

You can extend the script to load bioinformatics data (genes, proteins, diseases, drugs) into Neo4j.

Any changes to the code can be committed and pushed if you are contributing back to the repository.
