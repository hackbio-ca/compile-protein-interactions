  "40973403": "This chapter focuses on how advanced computational techniques can reveal common pathways and interactions seemingly between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and breast cancer (BC). It also highlights their roles in bridging the gap between neurodegenerative and oncogenic processes by analyzing gene networks and identifying essential genes such as GAPDH, HSP90AA1, and HSPA8, which show differential regulation in AD and BC. These genes are upregulated in AD and downregulated in BC, illustrating their involvement in both disease contexts. A significant aspect of the analysis is the role of hub-bottleneck proteins within critical pathways. These hub-bottleneck proteins, including those involved in estrogen signaling, Alzheimer's disease pathways, neurodegeneration, and cancer pathways, serve as central nodes in the PPI networks. Their positioning underscores their crucial role in mediating disease mechanisms and influencing the progression of both AD and BC. The chapter emphasizes integrating gene expression data with PPI networks to uncover these critical nodes and interactions contributing to both diseases. Using network-based analysis and transcriptomics integration tools, it provides a detailed understanding of how shared genetic markers and their interactions influence disease mechanisms. This approach enables the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets by revealing underlying molecular connections and critical pathways involving hub-bottleneck proteins. The insights gained from gene overlap and PPI networks can serve as valuable input data for future studies focused on structural analysis. By laying the groundwork for understanding shared pathways and protein interactions, the research sets the stage for more detailed structural investigations and the development of precision medicine strategies tailored to the specific molecular features of Alzheimer's and breast cancer, inspiring the development of more effective treatments.",
  "40973402": "The pathophysiological scenario of Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes the misfolding and mis-sorting of two cellular proteins: Amyloid-β as plaques and microtubule-associated protein Tau as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The protein oligomers are the short-lived but, highly reactive species which mediate toxicity, synaptic loss, neurodegeneration and ultimately cognitive decline. Tau oligomers can propagate through various pathway viz. the exosomal pathway, neurotransmission, cell-to-cell junction, bulk endocytosis and receptor-mediated internalization etc. The preparation, isolation and detection of oligomers were of immense importance in the current field for designing therapeutics and diagnostics. Microglia are the prime immune cells in brain which maintain the homeostasis via synaptic surveillance and tissue-remodeling. But, the senescent microglia mediate pro-inflammation, oxidative damage and phagocytosis in diseased brain. The extracellular Tau oligomers were found to interact with microglial purinergic receptor P2Y12 which then led to microglial migration, activation and phagocytosis via various remodeled actin structure. P2Y12 receptor mediates Tau oligomers-induced microglial chemotaxis by localizing with migratory actin structures such as- filopodia, lamellipodia, podosome etc. These beneficial roles of P2Y12 in microglial chemotaxis, actin remodeling and Tau clearance can be intervened as a therapeutic target in AD.",
  "40973401": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. It is characterized by chronic memory defects, alterations in behavior, and cognitive decline. AD is histopathologically characterized by two hallmarks: intracellular accumulation of Tau protein as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular deposition of amyloid beta. In this book chapter, we highlighted the microtubule-associated protein Tau, exploring its structural diversity and its distinct isoforms. It is an intrinsically disordered protein which lacks three-dimensional structure that are defined by their vast structural segments that undergo rapid and prolonged conformational alterations. It has not been possible to analyze the structure of disordered proteins since they often have different conformations and are very flexible. Tau proteins comprise various domains that significantly participate in physiology in neurons, including stabilizing microtubule structure and dynamics and axonal cargo transport. In its physiological state, Tau interacts with various molecules and proteins. By various post-translational modifications at specific sites in Tau protein, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation. Tau protein undergo pathological structural confirmation by hyperphosphorylation, forming insoluble oligomers, and developing as paired helical filaments. Finally, as the disease progressed, it accumulated inside the neurons as NFTs.",
  "40966293": "Synapse pruning sculpts neural circuits throughout life. The human Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor type B2 (LilrB2)/murine Paired immunoglobulin receptor B (PirB) receptors expressed in neurons and complement protein C4 have been separately implicated in pruning. Here, we report that C4d, a C4 cleavage product with unknown function, binds LilrB2/PirB with nanomolar affinity. C4d and LilrB2 colocalize at excitatory synapses in the human cerebral cortex as well as with beta amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD). C4d, as well as C4, increase with age and more so in AD. To examine whether C4d-PirB interactions can drive pruning, dendritic spines-the postsynaptic structure of excitatory synapses-were monitored on L5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex: A significant decrease in dendritic spine density occurred in WT with C4d exposure, but KO of PirB completely prevented this loss. Together, our findings reveal an unexpected physiological role for C4d in pruning and imply that different complement cascade components may collaborate to engage both neuronal and glial-specific effectors of synaptic pruning.",
  "40965127": "BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) is a prevalent endocrine malignancy with rising global incidence, particularly among women. Emerging evidence suggests a significant association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and TC, potentially mediated by hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms linking these diseases remain poorly understood. METHODS: We integrated transcriptomic datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE33630, GSE35570, GSE60542 for TC; GSE86468 for T2D) to identify shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and Cox regression analyses were employed to elucidate pathways and prognostic biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified 28 shared DEGs between TC and T2D, with CD44, TGFBI, RUNX2, and GJA1 as key hub genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis highlighted pathways involving cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, and NF-κB signaling. A risk model incorporating seven genes (e.g., PRDM1 [protective] and ZFPM2 [risk]) stratified TC patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes (p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: T2D and TC exhibit overlapping genetic dysregulation, particularly in pathways governing metabolic reprogramming and tumor microenvironment crosstalk. Notably, PRDM1 and ZFPFM2 may serve as therapeutic targets for TC in patients with concurrent diabetes.",

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to uncover potential associations between lipoprotein metabolism and clinical LOAD diagnosis, cognitive function, and treatment. METHODS: We performed a lipidomic analysis of plasma samples from 46 individuals with LOAD and 16 healthy controls to investigate the potential association between lipoprotein profiles, LOAD diagnosis and cognitive function. Then, we conducted a protein-protein interaction analysis to explore the potential therapeutic role of lipoprotein molecules in LOAD. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that ApoA2 and HDL ApoA2 may be negatively associated with LOAD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.798, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.654-0.973, p = 0.026; OR = 0.785, 95% CI = 0.634-0.972, p = 0.026, respectively), while LDL-3 triglycerides showed a potential positive association (OR = 6.051, 95% CI = 1.789-20.470, p = 0.004). Additionally, HDL-4 ApoA1 may be positively correlated with cognitive function in LOAD (p = 0.047, r² = 0.087). Moreover, our findings suggest that ApoA2 may interact with targets of approved AD drugs.

  "40959651": "Gene dysregulation in trisomy 21 can cause disorders of genes that are members of the heat-shock proteins (HSPs) family and contribute to the early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Down syndrome (DS). OBJECTIVE: Investigate in silico differently expressed genes (DEGs) of HSPs and the interaction with microRNAs (miRNAs) located in human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). METHODS: Two transcriptome libraries of human brain samples, datasets GSE5390 (DS) and GSE33000 (DA), were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and analyzed via GEO2R. DEGs with p-values (Adj p-values) <0.05 were analyzed via STRING. MiRNAs were identified in the miRbase database and analysis of their potential regulation on DEGs was performed using the DIANA tools. RESULTS: HSPE1, HSP90B1, HSPB8 and HSPA13 genes showed a different expression pattern in the transcriptomes of DS. The HSPA13 and HSPA2 genes showed an altered expression profile in the DS and AD datasets. In the predicted protein-protein interactions (PPI), we identified the interaction of HSPE1, HSP90B1, HSPB8 and HSPA13 with other HSP proteins. The miRNA encoded by Hsa21 (hsa-miR-155-5p) interacted with the HSPA13 gene. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that certain genes encoding members of the HSP family, and in particular the interaction between miR-155-5p and HSPA13, may be associated with AD in DS.",

This study presents the first integrative systems pharmacology analysis exploring the molecular mechanisms by which β-sitosterol (BS), a phytosterol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, mitigates 7KC-induced toxicity. Shared targets between BS and 7KC were identified through target prediction databases and subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using Cytoscape with bottleneck centrality. Top hub genes were functionally enriched using Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway tools, revealing BS's modulation of nuclear receptor activity, redox homeostasis, and OXPHOS pathways. BS targets were localized across cytosol, nucleus, and membrane compartments, supporting its multi-compartmental regulatory role. This mechanistic framework highlights BS as a potential nutraceutical intervention for 7KC-driven chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, NAFLD, and Alzheimer's disease, warranting further biological validation.",
  "40927314": "BACKGROUND: Synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study aimed to identify synaptic-related genes with diagnostic potential for AD. METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were overlapped with phenotype-associated module selected through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and synaptic-related genes. The overlapped hub genes were further processed using machine learning algorithms, intersected with module gene from protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed with DEGs, to yield co-hub genes. The diagnostic potentials of the co-hub genes were examined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Correlation between co-hub genes with clinical features and immune cell infiltration was analyzed. Finally, the expression of co-hub genes was analyzed in several datasets and validated in AD transgenic mice. RESULTS: A total of three co-hub genes were identified, including MAP1B, L1CAM, and GABBR2. GABBR2 showed area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.98, 0.81, and 0.88 in the training and two external validation datasets. GABBR2 was negatively correlate with beta- and gamma-secretase activities, and infiltration of natural killer T cells and effector memory CD8 T cells. Finally, GABBR2 was validated to be downregulated in AD transgenic mice, aligning with bioinformatic findings. GABBR2 overexpression in N2a/APP cells increased ADAM10 while decreased of BACE1, leading to upregulation of sAPPα while downregulation of sAPPβ.

  "40920787": "Anti-Aβ antibodies are important tools for identifying structural features of aggregates of the Aβ peptide and are used in many aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Our laboratory recently reported the generation of a polyclonal antibody, pAb2AT-L, that is moderately selective for oligomeric Aβ over monomeric and fibrillar Aβ and recognizes the diffuse peripheries of Aβ plaques in AD brain tissue but does not recognize the dense fibrillar plaque cores. This antibody was generated against 2AT-L, a structurally defined Aβ oligomer mimic composed of three Aβ-derived β-hairpins arranged in a triangular fashion and covalently stabilized with three disulfide bonds. In the current study, we set out to determine if pAb2AT-L is neuroprotective against toxic aggregates of Aβ and found that pAb2AT-L protects human iPSC-derived neurons from Aβ42-mediated toxicity at molar ratios as low as 1:100 antibody to Aβ42, with a ratio of 1:25 almost completely rescuing cell viability. Few other antibodies have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects at such low ratios of antibody to Aβ. ThT and TEM studies indicate that pAb2AT-L delays but does not completely inhibit Aβ42 fibrillization at sub-stoichiometric ratios. The ability of pAb2AT-L to inhibit Aβ42 toxicity and aggregation at sub-stoichiometric ratios suggests that pAb2AT-L binds toxic Aβ42 oligomers and does not simply sequester monomeric Aβ42. These results further suggest that toxic oligomers of Aβ42 share significant structural similarities with 2AT-L.",
  "40915373": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gastrodia elata, also known as Chijian, belongs to the Orchidaceae family of plants. The \"Compendium of Materia Medica\" records that Gastrodia elata treats \"confused speech, excessive fear, and loss of willpower\". Gastrodin (GAS) is the main bioactive component of Gastrodia elata. Research has shown that GAS possesses protective effects on multiple animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact molecular mechanism of GAS-mediated neuroprotection in AD pathology remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to determine whether GAS exerts neuroprotective effects on AD models through regulating β-catenin/c-Myc/MCT2 signaling axis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Behavioral and histopathological tests, including Morris water maze test, Nissl staining, and NeuN immunofluorescence staining in 3 × Tg-AD male mice, were used to assess the pharmacological effect of GAS on AD. To investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of GAS, we established an in vitro AD model using Aβ25-35-treated HT22 cells. The expressions of proteins and mRNA related to the β-catenin/c-Myc signaling axis were determined by western blotting and quantitative PCR. The change in energy metabolism was evaluated by measuring pyruvate, cellular ATP production, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The molecular mechanism of GAS-mediated neuroprotection was further explored using pharmacological and genetic interventions targeting β-catenin and c-Myc. Transcriptional regulation was interrogated through β-catenin chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with JASPAR-based motif prediction, while ligand-receptor interactions were characterized by AutoDock-based molecular docking validated through drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). RESULTS: In vivo experimental results revealed that GAS ameliorated cognitive impairment in 3 × Tg-AD mice, attenuated neuronal damage, and markedly inhibited the downregulation of active-β-catenin, c-Myc, and MCT2 in the hippocampal tissues. In Aβ25-35-challenged HT22 cells, the relevant protein levels of β-catenin/c-Myc signaling axis were reduced, with both mRNA and protein expressions of MCT2 declining, alongside reductions in pyruvate and ATP concentrations. GAS treatment reversed these pathological alterations, while this effect was antagonized by β-catenin and c-Myc inhibitors. Additionally, lentiviral-mediated β-catenin overexpression markedly increased MCT2 mRNA and protein expression in HT22 cells. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled with quantitative PCR and JASPAR-based motif prediction revealed that β-catenin bound to the MCT2 promoter region. Autodock Vina simulation demonstrated that GAS binds to β-catenin with a binding energy of less than -5 kcal/mol. Both DARTS and CETSA experiments showed that the binding of GAS to β-catenin protects the β-catenin protein from degradation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that GAS plays a protective role in experimental AD models through enhancing MCT2 expression and improving mitochondrial energy metabolism function by activation of the β-catenin/c-Myc/MCT2 signaling axis.",
  "40913132": "PURPOSE: Astrocyte reactivation can be assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) ligands targeting monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). 11C-SL25.1188 binds reversibly to MAO-B, allowing precise density measurements, but requires invasive arterial sampling. This study aimed to develop a simplified, noninvasive method to quantify MAO-B with 11C-SL25.1188 PET in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Six patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), five patients with AD, and six healthy controls (HCs) underwent 11C-SL25.1188 PET scans. The distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were calculated and compared using two methods: the original multilinear reference tissue model (MRTMO) and the Logan plot. Changes in MAO-B densities, plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels, and abnormal protein aggregation were examined among subjects. RESULTS: A strong agreement was observed between the DVRs estimated using MRTMO and those obtained with the Logan plot (r2 = 0.89), with the cerebellar cortex used as the reference region. This region was selected based on its similar total distribution volume values and comparable MAO-B levels between patients with AD and HCs. Patients with MCI showed higher DVRs in the parietal cortex compared to those with moderate AD. Moreover, patients with moderate AD had higher plasma GFAP levels than HCs but similar levels to patients with MCI. CONCLUSION: MAO-B density in patients with MCI/AD can be accurately estimated by calculating DVRs using a simplified quantification method that does not require arterial blood sampling. The estimated MAO-B density shows an increase that peaks at the MCI stage, suggesting early astrocyte reactivation in the progression of AD pathology. © 2025. The Author(s).",
  "40911470": "The development of drugs for Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for over half of all dementia cases, remains challenging. Amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ42) is widely recognized for its deposition in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, Aβ42-induced cell toxicity likely plays a role in disease onset. Molecular species present in the early stages, such as monomers and oligomers, are appropriate therapeutic targets for suppressing amyloid fibril formation and cell toxicity. In this study, we investigated the effects of bovine fibrinogen (bFg) and human fibrinogen (hFg) since these molecules have been known to exhibit chaperone-like activities. Our findings indicate that bFg exerts a strong inhibitory effect on amyloid fibril formation. Dot blot assays, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) suggest that bFg interacts with both Aβ42 monomers and oligomers. In contrast, human fibrinogen (hFg), which interacts only with oligomers, exhibits a weaker inhibitory effect on amyloid fibril formation. Moreover, bFg significantly rescued cells from Aβ42-induced toxicity, whereas hFg provided only partial protection. These findings underscore the potential of molecules targeting early stage Aβ42 species as promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment.",
  "40907839": "Arachidonic acid metabolism through cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways is fundamental to inflammation, vascular homeostasis, and neuronal signaling. Here, we investigated the roles of platelet-expressed COX (PTGS1) and LOX (ALOX12) isoforms in amyloid-β (Aβ) secretion, a process implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using an integrative approach combining bioinformatic protein-protein interaction mapping, pathway enrichment analysis, and experimental validation, we identified extensive networks linking PTGS and ALOX isoforms to cytoskeletal remodeling, mitochondrial function, and vesicle trafficking. Functional enrichment pointed to key roles for PTGS1 and ALOX12 in platelet activation and secretory processes. In vitro studies demonstrated that stimulation of human platelets with TRAP-6 triggered a robust increase in Aβ40 secretion, which was significantly attenuated by COX inhibition or blockade of RhoA, a critical regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics. These findings suggest that platelet-derived Aβ release is driven by COX/LOX-dependent signaling via RhoA. While our results support a COX/LOX-RhoA axis, we recognize that causality remains to be fully established, and the role of ALOX12 requires further experimental validation. Given the vascular deposition of Aβ40 in CAA, our results position platelets as important peripheral contributors to neurovascular amyloidosis. This study should therefore be viewed as hypothesis-generating, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting platelet signaling pathways to mitigate Aβ-driven vascular pathology.",

In neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are frequent features. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 is a key regulator of these processes. This review described the structure, membrane topology, and physiological function of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in neurons and glial cells. We emphasize how it affects mitophagy, oxidative damage, and changes in mitochondrial permeability. Special attention is focused on how voltage-dependent anion channel 1 interacts with pathogenic proteins that damage mitochondrial integrity and cause neurotoxicity, including mutant huntingtin, phosphorylated tau, α-synuclein, amyloid-beta, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43. Furthermore, the paper examines the function of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in astrocytic dysfunction and microglial activation, highlighting its impact on neuroinflammation. In a nutshell, we assess treatment strategies that target voltage-dependent anion channel 1, such as VBIT-4, a selective inhibitor of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 oligomerization, and newer methods, including structure-based drug design and CRISPR/Cas9 regulation.

The identification of molecular changes and interactions associated with Aβ-dependent cerebral amyloidosis is a need in the field. We hypothesize that structured datasets linking proteins to differentially abundant metabolites may provide an indirect but effective means of elucidating the processes and functions in which these metabolites are involved. The goal of this study was to identify core network modules related to AD-like cerebral amyloidosis to provide new insights into the molecular underpinnings of this brain disorder potentially associated with diet and microbiota modulation. METHODS: We performed fecal bacterial genotyping and untargeted metabolomic analysis of plasma and feces from wild-type and McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rats, a model of AD-like cerebral amyloidosis, that were exposed to a high-fat diet protocol. To identify relevant proteins associated with the discriminant metabolites, we used several structured databases. Protein-metabolite associations (both physical and functional) were retrieved, and a collection of AD-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were built using a near-neighborhood approach. RESULTS: A total of 44 bacterial genera and 636 plasma and 576 fecal metabolites were analyzed. From the discriminating metabolites of the Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) models, 657 networks were collected and a subset of the top 20 exploratory networks was defined. The first ranked network in terms of seed protein enrichment and number of participating metabolites showed strong biological signals of innate and adaptive immunity processes, with CD36 emerging as a central hub, orchestrating immunity, metabolic pathways, and fatty acid trafficking.

BIN1's participation in endocytosis, membrane remodeling, and modulation of actin dynamics is well-characterized in non-neuronal cells. In neurons, BIN1 is enriched at presynaptic sites, where it facilitates excitatory neurotransmitter vesicle release. However, how BIN1 is involved in synaptic vesicle dynamics is not well understood. A C-terminal Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain is invariant in all BIN1 isoforms and promotes protein-protein interactions with proteins harboring proline-rich motifs. While BIN1 interactions with dynamin, synaptojanin, RIN3, and tau have been identified and experimentally validated, the list of BIN1-interacting molecules is not exhaustive. Here, we report the neuronal scaffolding protein p140Cap, encoded by SRCIN1, as a BIN1 SH3 domain-interacting protein. We performed surface plasmon resonance to ascertain the affinity of BIN1-SH3 domain for p140Cap and identified a peptide containing three proline-rich motifs that exhibited biologically relevant affinity (KD = 7.7 μM). Additional surface plasmon resonance experiments, coupled with alanine-scanning mutagenesis, revealed that two class II motifs, but not a class I motif, in p140Cap facilitated binding. Confocal microscopy and proximity ligation assays confirmed that BIN1 colocalizes with, and is within molecular distance of, p140Cap in cultured cells and in the mouse brain. Co-immunoprecipitation assays validated the interaction, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down revealed that a rare BIN1 coding variant (rs138047593) significantly reduces p140Cap and tau binding, highlighting the impact of this mutant on interacting protein binding efficiency.

  "40859033": "A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β plaques in the brain. Amyloid-β is a 40-42 amino acid peptide generated by proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) via membrane-bound proteases. APP is a transmembrane protein, and its trafficking to sites of proteolysis represents a rate-limiting step in AD progression. Although APP processing has been well-studied, its trafficking itinerary and machinery remain incompletely understood. To address this, we performed an unbiased interaction screen for interactors of the APP cytosolic tail. We identified previously characterised APP binders as well as novel interactors, including RABGAP1. We demonstrated that RABGAP1 partially co-localises with APP and directly interacts with a YENPTY motif in the APP cytosolic tail. Depletion or overexpression of RABGAP1 caused mistrafficking and misprocessing of endogenous APP in human and rodent neurons. This effect is dependent on the GAP activity of RABGAP1, demonstrating that RABGAP1 affects the trafficking of APP by modulating RAB activity on endosomal subdomains.

This review explores how PTMs within intrinsically disordered regions drive epichaperome formation, how these scaffolds selectively regulate disease-enabling functions, and why their disruption normalizes pathological networks.

A primary issue is the lack of practicable strategies to balance emission wavelength and molecular weight, particularly for low-molecular-weight (<500 Da) NIR-II (λem > 1000 nm) dyes. Here, we propose a strategy that tunes NIR-II emissions by reducing Coulomb attraction interaction, contrasting with traditional approaches that redshift absorption wavelengths through energy gap reduction. Leveraging this concept, we extend the emission wavelength of GFP chromophore-based dyes LS1-12 from the visible range into the NIR-II region, achieving a maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1200 nm with molecular weights between 226 and 449 Da. Further, the optimized NIR-II dye LS7 selectively binds Aβ42 fibrils, yielding a 22.7-fold fluorescence increase in vitro and enabling real-time imaging of deposited Aβ proteins in the brains of living mice with Alzheimer's disease.

At present, there is no simple and reliable diagnostic method available for clinical application. Therefore, this study aims to identify potential biomarkers for AD using bioinformatics, providing new insights into its diagnosis. METHODS: This study utilized the transcriptome dataset GSE63060 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and applied bioinformatics approaches to identify candidate genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and machine learning techniques (LASSO, SVM-RFE, Boruta, and XGBoost) were employed on the GSE63060 dataset. Subsequently, the expression levels of the candidate genes were evaluated, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to identify hub genes and establish a corresponding network. Finally, we focused on the common upstream transcription factor c-Myc among the hub genes and conducted clinical experiments to validate its potential. Serum samples were collected from 41 AD patients treated at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University between October 2023 and November 2024, along with 41 control subjects. The c-Myc protein concentration was measured using ELISA, and a ROC curve was constructed to assess its diagnostic potential. RESULTS: This study identified four hub genes associated with AD: RPL36AL, NDUFA1, NDUFS5, and RPS25. Additionally, the concentration of the c-Myc protein was significantly different between the AD and control groups (p < 0.001). The diagnostic sensitivity was 87.8%, specificity was 51.2%, and the area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.753, suggesting that c-Myc has independent diagnostic significance for AD. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that RPL36AL, NDUFA1, NDUFS5, and RPS25 have potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. Additionally, the experiment suggests that c-Myc could serve as a promising blood biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.",

APOE 𝜀4 affects both risk and age at onset (AAO), with lower risk in AA populations. This study evaluates the independent and interactive effects of the AA-specific ABCA7 frameshift deletion and APOE 𝜀4 allele on AAO. METHODS: We analyzed 3510 AA individuals, including AD cases and controls. Cox regression models assessed the effects of ABCA7 deletion, APOE genotypes, and their interactive influence on AAO. RESULTS: APOE ε3/ε4 carriers with the ABCA7 deletion had a significantly shorter survival compared to ε3/ε4 carriers without the deletion. No significant differences were found between deletion carriers and non-carriers with APOE ε3/ε3 or ε4/ε4 genotypes. DISCUSSION: Our study showed that the ABCA7 deletion lowered the AAO of AD in APOE ε3/ε4 carriers from AA populations. These findings suggest that the AA-specific ABCA7 deletion and the APOE ε4 allele have synergistic effects on AAO. HIGHLIGHTS: AA-specific ABCA7 deletion lowers AAO of AD in APOE ε3/ε4 carriers from AA populations. Findings suggest an interaction between ABCA7 deletion and APOE ε4 on AAO. APOE ε4 has a strong, dose-dependent effect on AAO of AD in AA individuals. ABCA7 deletion impact on AAO of AD is stronger in females with APOE ε3/ε4. © 2025 The Author(s).

  "40830711": "Regulated cell death (RCD) pathways-once viewed as linear, independent processes-are now recognized as components of a dynamic, interconnected molecular network that dictates cellular fate in health and disease. This study presents a systematic meta-analysis of thirteen major RCD pathways, examining their molecular mechanisms, triggers, and interconnections through protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Using custom bioinformatics approaches, we unveiled the interactome of proteins involved in apoptosis, autophagy-dependent cell death, cellular senescence, mitotic catastrophe, entotic cell death, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, immunogenic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, mitochondrial permeability transition-driven necrosis, necroptosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation-related cell death (NETosis), parthanatos, and pyroptosis. By integrating data from an extensive literature review with STRING database analyses, we identified previously unrecognized cross-pathway interactions and regulatory nodes where special attention was given to the role of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in these pathways. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between different RCD mechanisms and highlight potential therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by dysregulated cell death programs, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. This comprehensive analysis provides new insights into the molecular architecture of RCD pathways and their cooperative functions in maintaining cellular homeostasis. © 2025.

  "40818508": "Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), comprising hyperphosphorylated and aggregated Tau protein, are a primary neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In patients, the formation and spread of NFTs across the brain correlate with cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms driving Tau aggregation and leading to the subsequent neuronal dysfunction are not fully understood. In this study, we explored proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes resulting from the seed-induced aggregation of endogenous Tau in human neurons, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered previously undescribed phosphorylation sites on NBR1, an autophagy receptor, which were significantly altered by Tau aggregation in vitro. We further show that NBR1 directly interacts with phosphorylated Tau and Tau aggregates in various cellular models. This interaction is associated with autophagic Tau degradation in HEK biosensor cells, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of NBR1 significantly increases Tau aggregate levels in iPSC-derived neurons. Additionally, we find that NBR1 expression is significantly increased in AD patients, and it specifically interacts with Tau in human AD brain, underscoring the relevance of our findings to the human disease. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions between autophagy receptors and Tau pathology in AD and reveal a role for NBR1 as an important receptor for pathological forms of Tau.",
  "40815569": "The protein α-synuclein, encoded by SNCA, accumulates in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies for reasons that remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether SNCA is regulated in vivo by the RNA-binding protein PUM1. We establish that PUM1 binds to SNCA's 3' UTR in mouse and human cells. In induced neurons from patients with SNCA locus triplication, PUM1 mRNA levels are lower than in healthy controls, but increasing PUM1 normalizes both SNCA mRNA and α-synuclein protein levels, largely by suppressing the long 3' UTR SNCA isoform. In microfluidic chamber experiments, silencing PUM1 causes a redistribution of SNCA between the soma and axons. We also show that the previously described miR-7 regulation of SNCA mRNA requires PUM1. Lastly, we report finding several individuals with PD in clinical databases bearing variants in PUM1 that affect its RNA-binding ability. Understanding how RNA-binding proteins regulate α-synuclein could lead to viable new therapies for synucleinopathies. Published by Elsevier Inc.",
  "40808471": "The neuroprotective role of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) has attracted considerable interest. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of SGLT2i in several common neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Utilizing drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) proximal to the SLC5A2 gene to analyze the influence of SGLT2i on AD, PD, ALS, and MS. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was used to probe the relationship of SGLT2i with other characteristics. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used to explore how SLC5A2 affects other proteins, and enrichment analysis was used to explore possible biological processes. The MR analysis showed that SGLT2i was negatively associated with AD (OR = 0.77, p = 0.01), PD (OR = 0.52, p = 0.04), ALS (OR = 0.60, p = 0.01), and MS (OR = 0.33, p = 0.027), indicating that SGLT2i could reduce the risk of AD by 23%, PD by 48%, ALS by 40%, and MS by 67%. The colocalization supported this conclusion. The PheWAS showed that SGLT2i was associated with body mass index and systolic blood pressure. SGLT2i is biologically closely related to the development of NDs. This study suggested that SGLT2i was able to reduce the risk of NDs. SGLT2i may perform this process through many mechanisms. This study provides a new perspective on the treatment of NDs; clinical trials and relevant experiments are necessary to further validate the neuroprotective effects of SGLT2i. © 2025 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
  "40806539": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive decline. Among the various susceptibility genes, the gene of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is probably the most important. It may be present in three allelic forms, termed ε2, ε3 and ε4, and the most common genotype is the ε3/ε3. Recently, it has been observed that subjects with the ε4/ε4 genotype may show near-full penetrance of AD biology (pathology and biomarkers), leading to the suggestion that ε4 homozygosity may represent a distinct genetic type of AD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ε4 homozygosity or heterozygosity in the presence or absence of the AD biomarker profile in patients with cognitive disorders in the Greek population. A total of 274 patients were included in the study. They underwent APOE genotyping and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiling. The presence of ε4 was associated with a lower age of symptom onset and decreased amyloid biomarkers (irrespective to AD or non-AD profiles), and predicted the presence of an AD profile by a positive predictive value approaching 100%. In conclusion, the ε4 allele has a significant effect on the risk and clinical parameters of cognitive impairment and AD in the Greek population, while the ε4/ε4 genotype may be highly indicative of the (co)existence of AD in cognitively impaired patients.",

This research investigated the potential causal link between Methyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and Alzheimer's disease and examined underlying molecular mechanisms. Mendelian randomization analysis evaluated causality, using Cochran's Q test, the Mendelian Randomization-Egger intercept test, and Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier to assess heterogeneity and sensitivity. Methyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid targets were identified through multiple databases, and a related target library was constructed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, differential gene expression analysis, and the Genecards database. A Protein-Protein Interaction network identified core genes, validated by molecular docking. Transcriptomic analysis and single-cell expression data explored cell-type-specific expression patterns. Results showed a significant positive causal association between Methyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and Alzheimer's disease. We identified 198 Methyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid targets, with 99 genes associated with both Methyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and Alzheimer's disease. Six core genes (EGFR, ESR1, MAPK3, MMP9, PTGS2, TP53) were pinpointed. Functional enrichment implicated neuronal signaling, inflammation, and metabolism. Multi-omics and single-cell analyses revealed differential expression of core genes in key brain regions. Molecular docking confirmed stable interactions between Methyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and these proteins.

  "40768643": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a complex and unmet medical challenge, requiring innovative approaches to address its multifaceted pathology. In this study, we explored chromeno[3,4-b]xanthones as a novel multifunctional scaffold, synthesized via the straightforward cyclization of their precursor, (E)-2-styrylchromones. Compounds 10 and 11q-s exhibited potent and selective cholinesterase inhibition (IC50 1.7-9.0 μM for AChE and BChE), along with significant antiamyloid activity (inhibition exceeding 50% at 50 μM). Among them, compound 11r demonstrated the most well-balanced multifunctional profile against all four AD-relevant targets. Molecular docking studies revealed key π-stacking, hydrogen bonding, and halogen interactions, which underlie the selective binding of compound 11r to AChE and BChE. Moreover, docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that compound 11r binds strongly to the L-S-shaped β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42) fibril with a binding affinity of -11.3 kcal/mol, representing a structural barrier to Aβ42 elongation. Additionally, compound 11r, selected as the representative scaffold, effectively disrupted Aβ aggregation, as demonstrated by in vitro studies, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cellular studies. It also displayed favorable drug-like properties, including predicted blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and an acceptable safety profile at active doses. The calcein-AM-assay also showed that this compound is unlikely to be actively effluxed from the brain. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of chromeno[3,4-b]xanthone as multifunctional agents for AD, broadening the chemical space of small-molecule exploration.",
  "40763857": "Numerous neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, are associated with the misfolding and aggregation of proteins. In this study, we investigate the protective role of the natural alkaloid berberine against protein misfolded aggregates, given its potential as a therapeutic agent. Our findings demonstrate that berberine binds to the lipid membranes of reconstituted liposomes with diverse lipid compositions and can cross lipid membranes via diffusion. Correspondingly, in cultured human neuroblastoma cells, berberine interacts with the plasma membrane and is rapidly internalized into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, berberine exhibited rapid and dose-dependent protective effects upon exposing LUVs or cells to misfolded protein aggregates able to induce lipid membrane damage. Specifically, in human neuroblastoma cells pre-treated with berberine, the molecule reduced plasma membrane alterations and the associated Ca2+ ion influx, diminished the production of reactive oxygen species, and reduced mitochondrial metabolism dysfunction, induced by the aggregates. Concomitant administration of berberine and aggregates was not found to be protective against aggregates and, moreover, berberine does not significantly modify the structure of the protein aggregates, suggesting that its protective effect against these aberrant species in cells is due to its ability to rapidly interact with and cross the cell membrane. Together, these findings provide insight into the mechanism of protective action of berberine and support its therapeutic potential in mitigating cellular damage associated with protein aggregation.",
  "40760501": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, leading to the formation of neurotoxic soluble oligomers (AβOs) that impair calcium homeostasis in neurons and astrocytes. Aducanumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting aggregated Aβ, has been approved for AD treatment due to its ability to reduce amyloid plaque burden. However, its specificity toward different AβO species and its functional impact on calcium homeostasis remain unclear. METHODS: We investigated aducanumab's ability to recognize and immunodeplete low-molecular-weight (LMW) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) AβOs using three Aβ preparations: (1) transgenic conditioned media (TgCM) from cultured Tg2576 neurons, (2) synthetic Aβ42-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), and (3) TBS-soluble fractions from aged Tg2576 mouse brain. Size exclusion chromatography and ELISA were used to characterize AβO species. Multiphoton calcium imaging of neuron-astrocyte co-cultures was performed to assess the impact of aducanumab on AβO-induced calcium overload. RESULTS: Aducanumab preferentially bound and immunodepleted HMW AβOs in ADDLs and the TBS-soluble fraction of Tg2576 mouse brain extracts but did not recognize LMW AβOs in TgCM. In calcium imaging experiments, all three AβO preparations induced calcium overload in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. Immunodepletion with aducanumab prevented calcium overload in cultures exposed to ADDLs and Tg2576 brain extracts but not in those treated with immunodepleted TgCM, indicating that aducanumab selectively neutralizes HMW AβOs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that aducanumab specifically targets HMW AβOs, mitigating their neurotoxic effects by restoring intracellular calcium homeostasis. These results provide mechanistic insight into aducanumab's therapeutic action and support its potential role in modifying AD pathology by selectively neutralizing Aβ species. © 2025.

  "40758965": "Exploring the role of the pattern recognition receptor Dectin-1 in neurological diseases emerges as an important target for understanding the biochemical and physiological dynamics of neuropathologies. From this perspective, Dectin-1, protein encoded by the CLEC7A gene, stands out for its important role in antifungal immunity; however, the receptor also proves crucial in enabling the immune response of the central nervous system (CNS). This review highlights how Dectin-1 interacts with microglial cells, as well as the implications of these interactions in inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric processes. In this regard, the narrative also revisits relevant discussions on the signaling pathways associated with Dectin-1, including the activation of tyrosine-protein kinase (Syk) and the production of inflammatory cytokines. It is noteworthy that altered expression of Dectin-1 has been observed in various conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, thereby contributing to neuroinflammatory processes. However, in contrast to this, in depressive disorders, the receptor has shown the ability to modulate the inflammatory response, triggering antidepressant effects. Therefore, understanding the pluralistic role of Dectin-1 in the CNS may offer new scientific perspectives that will enable the development of more targeted therapies for neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases in different pathological contexts.",

  "40752663": "Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), a widely used plasticizer, has been suggested to be neurotoxic. We aim to explore possible molecular mechanisms of DBP on Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a combined approach of network toxicology, molecular docking and experimental validations. We retrieved targets of DBP from ChEMBL and STITCH databases, while obtaining AD-related targets from GeneCards and OMIM databases. We identified 193 overlapping targets, and highlighted 13 core targets by protein-protein interaction analysis. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that these targets are mainly enriched in neuroinflammation, synaptic signaling, and metabolic pathways. Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities for AD-related proteins, including translocator protein (TSPO), transcription factor c-Jun (JUN), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2). In validation, we exposed DBP (0-200 μM) to N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells for 48 h. Western-blot demonstrated significant upregulation of TSPO, JUN, CDKN1A, and PTGS2, while ESR1 showed an upward trend without statistical significance.

  "40742404": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by pathological protein aggregation and oxidative stress, leading to progressive neurodegeneration. Enhancing autophagy, the primary intracellular pathway for clearing misfolded proteins, represents a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, we identify Araloside A (ARA), a triterpenoid saponin derived from Aralia elata, as a potent autophagy inducer that alleviates AD- and PD-related pathology. In neuronal cell models, ARA promotes autophagosome formation, increases LC3-II and Beclin-1 levels, and decreases P62, indicating enhanced autophagic activity. Mechanistic investigations reveal that ARA directly binds to Raf, MEK, and ERK proteins and activates autophagy in a Raf/MEK/ERK-dependent manner. This activation facilitates the clearance of APP, total Tau, phosphorylated Tau, and α-synuclein, thereby reducing cytotoxicity. Furthermore, in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models of AD and PD, ARA treatment alleviates protein aggregation and behavioral deficits via ERK-dependent autophagy. Together, these findings identify ARA as a natural compound that enhances autophagic clearance of neurotoxic aggregates via Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation, offering promising therapeutic insights for neurodegenerative proteinopathies. © 2025.

E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s), crucial for protein degradation, are implicated in AD, but their specific contributions to its progression remain to be elucidated.ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify dysregulated E3s in AD and elucidate the role of a hub E3, FBXW7, in its pathogenesis and tau protein regulation.MethodsWe integrated four datasets to identify differentially expressed E3s (DE-E3s) in AD and performed functional enrichment and PPI network analyses. Machine learning identified hub E3s and stratified AD patients into molecular subtypes. Furthermore, we validated the expression and functional role of FBXW7 using western blot, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP).ResultsWe identified 42 DE-E3s primarily enriched in protein ubiquitination and Notch signaling pathways. FBXW7 and ENC1 emerged as hub E3s, stratifying patients into two subtypes. Subtype I exhibited enrichment of inflammatory pathways, suggesting immune dysregulation. Conversely, subtype II displayed activation of pathways associated with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss, potentially representing distinct primary pathological features. Furthermore, we observed decreased FBXW7 expression in AD models compared to controls. Notably, FBXW7 interacted with Tau protein. Overexpression of FBXW7 reduced the levels of both total Tau and p-Tau Ser262, and this reduction in Tau levels was reversed by MG132 treatment.ConclusionsThis study comprehensively identified E3s associated with AD, with our findings highlighting FBXW7 as a potential key regulator of AD pathogenesis through its modulation of tau protein levels.",
  "40721030": "Convergence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) in endosomes initiates the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that accumulate in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. APP and BACE1 are segregated in neurons, and mechanisms triggering their convergence have remained poorly understood, limiting therapeutic attempts to reduce Aβ production. Neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a cell surface localized protein, which increases Aβ levels via mechanisms that are not known. We show that APP binds to the extracellular domain of NCAM2. The intracellular domain of NCAM2 binds to the Rab11 adaptor protein Rab11-FIP5. The NCAM2/APP complex is endocytosed from the cell surface and targeted to BACE1-containing Rab11-positive recycling endosomes where it is processed. Convergence of APP with BACE1 is increased in transfected CHO cells and neurons expressing NCAM2. Consequently, the levels of amyloidogenic APP cleavage products are increased in cells expressing NCAM2. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, APP accumulates at the cell surface and in early endosomes, and APP levels in recycling endosomes are reduced. Aβ production is increased by Aβ oligomers and neuronal activity, and we show that the binding of NCAM2 to APP is increased in neurons treated with Aβ oligomers or after activation of synaptic NMDA receptors. Together, our data indicate that NCAM2 binds to APP and promotes APP targeting from the neuronal cell surface to recycling endosomes where APP is cleaved by BACE1. This novel mechanism regulating the convergence of APP and BACE1 in neurons can contribute to Aβ accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.",
  "40719250": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by cognitive decline, particularly in memory and reasoning, which often culminates in severe dementia. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying AD remain elusive. One of the key contributors to AD pathogenesis is the dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an organelle involved in protein folding, calcium regulation, and lipid metabolism. When ER function is compromised, it leads to ER stress, a condition increasingly associated with AD development. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular mechanism that, when overstressed, can result in neuronal death. Further research has revealed how ER stress interacts with other hallmark features of AD, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting ER stress and its associated pathways could present new therapeutic avenues for AD. This review examines the role of the ER in AD, outlining the mechanisms through which ER dysfunction accelerates disease progression and evaluating novel therapeutic strategies designed to restore ER balance and mitigate AD symptoms. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

  "40710748": "Aggregation of tau protein is a hallmark feature of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. The microtubule-binding domain of tau plays a crucial role in the tau aggregation process. In this study, we investigated the dual effects of membrane interactions of tau298-317, a fragment peptide from the microtubule-binding domain, on peptide-induced membrane disruption and membrane-mediated peptide self-assembly. Our results show that neither wild-type tau298-317 nor its P301L or Ser305-phosphorylated mutants aggregate in the presence of zwitterionic POPC vesicles or cause lipid vesicle leakage, indicating weak peptide-membrane interactions. In contrast, tau298-317 strongly interacts with negatively charged POPG liposomes, leading to a rapid transition of the peptide conformation from random coils to α-helical intermediate conformation upon membrane adsorption, which may further promote peptide self-association to form oligomers and β-sheet-rich fibrillar structures. Tau298-317-induced rapid POPG membrane leakage indicates a synergistic process of the peptide self-assembly at the membrane interface and the aggregation-induced membrane disruption. Notably, phosphorylation at Ser305 disrupts favorable electrostatic interactions between the peptide and POPG membrane surface, thus preventing peptide aggregation and membrane leakage. In contrast, the P301L mutation significantly enhances membrane-mediated peptide aggregation and peptide-induced membrane disruption, likely due to alleviation of local conformational constraints and enhancement of local hydrophobicity, which facilitates fast conformational conversion to β-sheet structures. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane-mediated aggregation of crucial regions of tau and peptide-induced membrane damage, indicating potential strategies to prevent tau aggregation and membrane rupture by targeting critical electrostatic interactions between membranes and key local regions of tau.",
  "40709254": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to the loss of motor neurons, resulting in paralysis and death. Currently, there are no specific biomarkers available for diagnosing ALS.

The absence of a specific, reliable diagnostic tool has hindered both early intervention and therapeutic progress. Here we develop a novel synthetic antibody that can detect a toxic form of a known protein linked to ALS. This trimeric assembly of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is a soluble, structurally distinct oligomer that is highly toxic in cell models. The antibody selectively binds this trimer and differentiates individuals with the disease from healthy people and from those with other neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease).

  "40707822": "Immunosuppressive myeloid cells are important in a variety of physiological and pathological contexts, including tumor development, but how hormones might regulate their activity is unclear. Secretogranins, a family of secretory proteins in endocrine and neuronal cells, are proposed to function as prohormones or hormones, but their specific receptors are unknown. Here we show that secretogranin 2 (SCG2), a granin family member, functionally interacts with leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) on monocytic cells. Tumor-derived SCG2 promotes tumor growth in myeloid-specific LILRB4 transgenic mice in a T cell-dependent manner, whereas SCG2 deficiency in host mice impairs tumor progression and reduces infiltration of immunosuppressive monocytic cells. Blockade of LILRB4 abrogates SCG2-induced signaling, immunosuppression and tumor growth. Mechanistically, this SCG2-LILRB4 interaction triggers SHP recruitment and SHP-independent STAT3 activation.

  "40706937": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) contributes significantly to neuronal degeneration and is linked to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Iron increases synthesis rates of the Alzheimer's APP through an iron responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop in their 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTRs). Docking results revealed the binding of APP IRE with eIF4F with appreciable binding affinity, making several close interactions involving hydrogen bonding. Fluorescence based binding revealed APP IRE binds specifically to eIF4F with a nanomolar affinity. Iron (labile as Fe2+) further increased APP IRE binding to eIF4F, which outcompetes with IRP1 binding. Thermodynamic parameters of APP IRE∙eIF4F interactions were elucidated further by utilizing temperature dependence binding affinity data. It was quite evident from the thermodynamic calculations that APP IRE spontaneously binds to eIF4F with a postulated existence of hydrogen bonding. Fe2+ increased the enthalpic (ΔH) and free energy (ΔG) contribution to the APP IRE∙eIF4F complex formation, resulting in a more stable complex formation through increasing hydrogen bonding. This suggests that iron plays specific role on thermodynamics of these RNA-protein interactions. Exogenous eIF4F restored iron-dependent APP mRNA translation in vitro in eIF4F-depleted extracts. Fe2+ increases APP mRNA translation. Whereas IRP1 inhibits APP expression. Furthermore, addition of Fe2+ reversed IRP1 inhibition of protein synthesis by reducing inhibitor protein (IRP1) binding and increasing activator protein (eIF4F) binding.

  "40706494": "There are five different types of the hepatotropic hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, and HEV). Infection with all hepatitis viruses leads to the development of disease, and all of them are capable of co-infection and super-infection; i.e., the presence of more than one type of hepatitis virus in an infected individual. Typically, co-infections cause more severe illness. Although many facets of virus-host interactions are known, important aspects related to the prevalence and functionality of intrinsic disorder in viral interactomes remain mostly unexplored. Even less is known about prevalence and roles of intrinsic disorder in proteins related to the hepatotropic co-infections. The goal of this study is to fill this gap by conducting the bioinformatics analysis of intrinsic disorder in host proteins interacting with hepatotropic viruses, with special focus on host proteins that can interact with more than one type of hepatitis viruses. To this end, a set of computational tools was used to evaluate disorder status of proteins, their predisposition for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and interactivity. This analysis revealed that some viral proteins were predicted to have high LLPS potential. Host proteins interacting with hepatotropic viruses were characterized by noticeable variation in their intrinsic disorder status and LLPS potential. Although global disorder distribution within the sets of host proteins interacting with hepatitis viruses was not too different from that of the entire human proteome, more host proteins interacting with hepatitis viruses were predicted as moderately disordered in comparison with the entire human proteome. Intrinsic disorder was shown to be commonly present in host proteins shared by several hepatotropic viruses, where it is used for various functional properties.",
  "40691577": "BACKGROUND: FAM19A5 is a secretory protein primarily expressed in neurons. Although its role in synaptic function has been suggested, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its effects at the synapse remain unclear. Given that synaptic loss is a critical hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), elucidating the mechanisms involving FAM19A5 could provide valuable insights into reversing synaptic loss in AD. METHODS: The binding partner of FAM19A5 was identified through co-immunoprecipitation experiments of mouse brain tissue. The effect of FAM19A5 on spine density in hippocampal neurons was evaluated using immunocytochemistry by overexpressing FAM19A5, treating neurons with FAM19A5 protein, and/or an anti-FAM19A5 antibody NS101. Target engagement of NS101 was determined by measuring FAM19A5 levels in mouse, rat, and human plasma at specific time points post NS101 injection using ELISA. Changes in spine density and dynamics in P301S tauopathy mice were assessed via Golgi staining and two-photon microscopy after NS101 administration. The synaptic strengthening of hippocampal neurons in APP/PS1 amyloidopathy mice after NS101 treatment was assessed by measuring miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). Cognitive performance in AD mice after NS101 treatment was measured using the Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. RESULTS: FAM19A5 binds to LRRC4B, a postsynaptic adhesion molecule, leading to reductions in spine density in mouse hippocampal neurons. Inhibiting FAM19A5 function with NS101 increased spine density. Intravenous administration of NS101 increased spine density in the prefrontal cortex of P301S mice, which initially showed reduced spine density compared to wild-type (WT) mice. NS101 normalized the spine elimination rate in P301S mice, restoring the net spine count to levels comparable to WT mice. NS101 treatment enhanced the frequency of mEPSCs and fEPSPs in the hippocampal synapses of APP/PS1 mice, leading to improved cognitive function. The increases in plasma FAM19A5 levels upon systemic NS101 administration suggest that the antibody effectively engages its target and facilitates the transport of FAM19A5 from the brain. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that inhibiting FAM19A5 function with an anti-FAM19A5 antibody restores synaptic integrity and enhances cognitive function in AD, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

  "40678591": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. OBJECTIVE: To identify diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for AD. METHODS: Based on three GEO datasets of human brain tissue from AD patients and controls, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and enrichment analysis were used to identify AD-related gene modules. Hub genes were screened via protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and three machine learning algorithms. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Immune cell infiltration and hub gene expression correlations were analyzed using xCell. In vivo validation was performed using an AD mouse model. RESULTS: The magenta module was significantly correlated with AD. PPI network analysis identified 15 AD-related genes, mainly enriched in mitochondria and ribosomes. Two hub genes, DLAT and CCDC88b, were identified. DLAT was significantly downregulated in AD, and CCDC88b was upregulated (p < 0.01); both findings were validated via qPCR in AD model mice. ROC analysis showed good diagnostic performance. Immune infiltration analysis revealed macrophages as the dominant cell type, with hub gene expression associated with immune cell presence. CONCLUSIONS: DLAT and CCDC88b are potential novel biomarkers for AD and may serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. © The Author(s) 2025.",
  "40676669": "BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is closely associated with the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The α1-adrenergic receptor (ADRA1), a G protein-coupled receptor, has been identified as a critical therapeutic target in inflammatory disorders. However, its precise mechanistic role in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. METHODS: To investigate ADRA1's role in AD, we employed 3xTg-AD and wild-type (WT) mice, modulating neuronal ADRA1 expression via intracerebroventricular delivery of adeno-associated viruses. Cognitive function, tau pathology, neuronal morphology, and activation of the STING/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway were evaluated using behavioral tests, Western blot, Golgi-Cox staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. In vitro AD models were established using Aβ42 oligomer-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells and primary murine neurons, along with SH-SY5Y cells transfected with full-length human tau (SH-SY5Y/htau). Pharmacological antagonists, inhibitors, lentiviral transduction, co-immunoprecipitation, and calcium flux assays were utilized to dissect ADRA1-mediated molecular mechanisms in tauopathy and neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Hippocampal ADRA1 expression was significantly elevated in 10-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Neuronal ADRA1 knockdown suppressed STING/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway activation, ameliorated tauopathy and neuroinflammation, restored neuronal structure/function, and improved cognitive deficits in 3xTg-AD mice. Conversely, ADRA1 overexpression in C57/BL6 mice induced tauopathy, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, ADRA1 interacts with CXCR4 to form heterodimers, triggering cytoplasmic Ca2⁺ overload and subsequent STING/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway activation. CONCLUSIONS: ADRA1 critically mediates tauopathy and neuroinflammation through STING/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling. These results identify ADRA1 as a promising therapeutic target for AD prevention and treatment. © 2025. The Author(s).",
  "40670811": "DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genome-wide methylation analysis of multi-tissue data can provide insights into the pathology and diagnostic biomarkers of AD. Computational tools were employed to identify pathways associated with AD and to develop a poly-methylation score (PMS). Key genes within the identified pathways were determined through module analysis and protein-protein interaction networks followed by validation in β-amyloid 42-induced cellular models. Linear mixed-effects model was used to investigate the longitudinal relationship between PMS and changes in AD phenotypes. AD-related pathways exhibited tissue specificity. The key genes in blood, frontal cortex, neurons, and glial cells were THBS1, TGFB1, HIF1A, and KLF4, respectively. Furthermore, the expression alterations of these genes were validated in three cellular models (SH-SY5Y, HMC3, and THP-1). Notably, higher PMS was significantly correlated with accelerated declines in cerebral metabolic rate and cognitive function. Using machine learning to analyze methylation data and identify key genes in AD patients enhanced our understanding of AD pathogenesis. Further research is needed to validate the potential of these key genes as intervention targets for AD. © 2025.

  "40663323": "Cyclic peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for targeting challenging protein-protein interactions (PPIs), combining high affinity, specificity, stability, and potential for improved drug-like properties. The outlined protocol describes a streamlined method for side chain-to-side chain lactam cyclization in a peptide array format based on the μSPOT method. The approach enables efficient synthesis and screening of cyclic peptide libraries with minimal synthetic effort, focusing on exploring cyclization positions and linker topology. The method is exemplified by developing cyclic peptide modulators of the APP/Mint2 PPI, a target implicated in Alzheimer's disease. The workflow integrates orthogonal protection strategies, analytical controls, and array-based binding assays, enabling the identification of binding-optimized cyclic peptides. Follow-up validation through fluorescence polarization assays demonstrated a strong correlation with array-based relative binding data (r2 = 0.88). The described approach is versatile and scalable, offering a robust platform for discovering novel cyclic peptides with enhanced stability, affinity, and permeability, paving the way for advanced therapeutic applications in PPI modulation. © 2025.

  "40661462": "DCPS modulates TDP-43 mediated neurodegeneration through P-body regulation. Ye Y, Zhang Z, Xiao Y, Zhu C, Wright N, Asbury J, Huang Y, Wang W, Gomez-Isaza L, Troncoso JC, He C, Sun S. The proteinopathy of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43, characterized by nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic inclusion, is a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening in human neurons, we identified the decapping enzyme scavenger (DCPS) as a novel genetic modifier of TDP-43 loss-of-function (LOF)-mediated neurotoxicity. Our findings reveal that TDP-43 LOF leads to aberrant mRNA degradation, via disrupting the properties and function of processing bodies (P-bodies). TDP-43 interacts with P-body component proteins, potentially influencing their dynamic equilibrium and assembly into ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. Reducing DCPS restores P-body integrity and RNA turnover, ultimately improving neuronal survival. Overall, this study highlights a novel role of TDP-43 in RNA processing through P-body regulation and identifies DCPS as a potential therapeutic target for TDP-43 proteinopathy-related neurodegenerative diseases.",
  "40661231": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, while the existing treatments primarily focus on alleviating symptoms rather than addressing the underlying pathophysiology. Seeking a safer alternative, the study explores the potential of Piper chaba Hunter as a promising drug lead for AD by eliciting the major signaling pathway, key players, and their interaction with phytochemicals from the plant extract. Initially, the phytochemicals in the P. chaba crude extract were identified using GC-MS, and their physicochemical properties were verified using SwissADME. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and signaling pathways-target proteins-compounds (STC) networks were analyzed to dig out target proteins and effective compounds for AD based on rigorous screening. Approximately 60 target proteins that interacted with GC-MS-identified compounds underwent PPI and STC networking which identified five compounds, a signaling pathway, and three target proteins with therapeutic potential. Three compounds, namely, bicyclo[7.2.0]undec-4-ene, 4,11,11-trimethyl-8-methylene-,[1R-(1R∗,4Z,9S∗)], 2-methoxybenzoic acid, 2,3-dichlorophenyl ester, and (E)-3-butylidene-4,5-dihydroisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one, have the potential to modulate PTGS2, PLA2G4A, and CYP2C19 within metabolic signaling pathway, thus serving as promising therapeutic agents. Moreover, the drug likeliness and efficacy of those phytochemicals were justified by molecular docking tests (MDTs), molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs), and quantum chemistry analyses, which confirmed their ability to inhibit key targets to mitigate AD-associated pathology.",
  "40654744": "The APOE gene is a major genetic determinant of neurovascular and immune function, yet the mechanisms by which its isoforms modulate brain vulnerability to pathogenic stress remain incompletely understood. Here, we employ isogenic human iPSC-derived immune-vascularized-Forebrain Organoid-based Multicellular Assembled Cerebral Organoids (FORMA-COs)-to dissect isoform-specific responses to a clinically relevant viral challenge. We find that APOE2/2 and APOE4/4 FORMA-COs exhibit heightened viral RNA burden and distinct neuroinflammatory profiles compared to APOE3/3. Specifically, APOE4/4 promotes IL-1α and VEGFA induction, whereas APOE2/2 leads to elevated TNF-β and VEGFA protein accumulation, indicating divergent pathways of injury. Integrated transcriptomic analyses, combined with known and predicted APOE protein-protein interaction networks, reveal genotype-dependent enrichment of cytokine signaling, angiogenic remodeling, and immune dysregulation. In vivo validation using humanized mouse models corroborates APOE genotype-specific vascular remodeling, microglial activation, and oligodendrocyte perturbation. These findings demonstrate that APOE genotype confers context-specific susceptibility to neuroimmune and vascular injury, providing insight into genetic risk mechanisms underlying infection-related and neurodegenerative brain disorders.",
  "40653809": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, posing significant challenges to cognitive, emotional, social, and financial well-being. The biochemical and molecular pathways associated with AD are complex, making it difficult to study and simulate in patients or through in vitro research. Thus, animal models play a crucial role in investigating the development and progression of AD. One widely used model in neuroscience studies is the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The development of transgenic animals has allowed for the construction of the dvls2 (CL2006) C. elegans strain, which constitutively expresses the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. This study conducted a proteomic analysis on the dvls2 (CL2006) strain. Also, a cross-species comparative analysis was performed using microarray data from AD patients to identify genes with ontology in the dvls2 (CL2006). A total of 543 proteins were found to be differentially regulated in the dvls2 (CL2006) strain. Furthermore, in the analysis of the human datasets, 397 upregulated and 767 downregulated genes were identified. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed in Ortholist to identify their orthologs in C. elegans. Then, the orthologous genes in the dvls2 (CL2006) model were compared to the proteomic data, resulting in the identification of 29 upregulated and 24 downregulated proteins (DEPs). Functional enrichment analysis of DEPs revealed terms related to pyruvate, glucose, and glutamate metabolism, in addition to binding activities to unfolded proteins and ligases, highlighting the upregulation of chaperone and ubiquitination-associated proteins. Protein-protein network (PPI) was performed for the human DEGs and DEPs of dvls2 (CL2006). Topological analyses of the networks were performed, revealing the following C. elegans hub proteins: EEF-2, ALH-13, ENOL-1, RPL-2, TPI-1, CTS-1, RPL-9, RPL-23, CCT-1, and RPS-8. eEF-2 was identified as a key regulator of the human AD PPI and dvls2 (CL2006). Modules were analyzed in the networks, and the presence of key regulators was identified. This study provides the first proteomic characterization of the AD model dvls2 (CL2006) and a cross-species comparative analysis with data from AD individuals, supporting the use of dvls2 (CL2006) in AD studies. © 2025 The Author(s).

  "40653482": "BACKGROUND: Analyzing disease-linked genetic variants via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) helps identify potential disease-causing genes. Previous research prioritized genes by integrating Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results with tissue-level eQTLs. Recent studies have explored brain cell type-specific eQTLs, but a systematic analysis across multiple Alzheimer's disease (AD) genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets or comparisons between tissue-level and cell type-specific effects remain limited. Here, we integrated brain cell type-level and bulk-level eQTL datasets with AD GWAS datasets to identify potential causal genes. METHODS: We used Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Bayesian Colocalization (COLOC) to integrate AD GWAS summary statistics with eQTLs datasets. Combining data from five AD GWAS, two single-cell eQTL datasets, and one bulk eQTL dataset, we identified novel candidate causal genes and further confirmed known ones. We investigated gene regulation through enhancer activity using H3K27ac and ATAC-seq data, performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) and pathway enrichment, and conducted a drug/compound enrichment analysis with Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB) to support drug repurposing for AD. RESULTS: We identified 28 candidate causal genes for AD, of which 12 were uniquely detected at the cell-type level, 9 were exclusive to the bulk level and 7 detected in both. Among the 19 cell-type level candidate causal genes, microglia contributed the highest number of candidate genes, followed by excitatory neurons, astrocytes, inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). PABPC1 emerged as a novel candidate causal gene in astrocytes. We generated PPI networks for the candidate causal genes and found that pathways such as membrane organization, cell migration, and ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling were enriched. The AD-risk variant associated with candidate causal gene PABPC1 is located near or within enhancers only active in astrocytes. We classified the 28 genes into three drug tiers and identified druggable interactions, with imatinib mesylate emerging as a key candidate. A drug-target gene network was created to explore potential drug targets for AD. CONCLUSIONS: We systematically prioritized AD candidate causal genes based on cell type-level and bulk level molecular evidence. The integrative approach enhances our understanding of molecular mechanisms of AD-related genetic variants and facilitates interpretation of AD GWAS results. © 2025. The Author(s).",
  "40649921": "The family of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) comprises three isoforms (VDAC-1, VDAC-2, VDAC-3). VDACs have been extensively described as localised in the outer mitochondrial membrane where they are involved in the exchange of ions, metabolites, and ATP/ADP between mitochondria and cytosol. The VDAC interacts with disease-specific proteins and thus regulates the mitochondrial function and controls the cellular energy resources, explaining its involvement in cell death and apoptosis. In addition, VDAC-1 and -2 can also be found at other cellular locations such as in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, in the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as in the plasma membrane. Through single-channel pore regulation, oligomerisation, or changed expression levels the VDAC is involved in different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and others. Here, we critically summarise current discussions about the VDAC as a common key player for these diseases. We suggest that the VDAC acts as a transmembrane multifunctional regulatory protein which might serve as a pharmacological target for the development of novel drugs against neurodegenerative diseases such as the application of recombinant antibody technology.",
  "40649837": "Network-based GWAS (NetWAS) has advanced brain imaging research by identifying genetic modules associated with brain alterations. However, how imaging risk genes exert functions in brain diseases, particularly their mediation through imaging quantitative traits (iQTs), remains underexplored. We propose a module-level polygenic risk score (MPRS)-based NetWAS framework to uncover genetic modules associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the mediation of an iQT, using amygdala density as a case study. Our framework integrates genotype data, brain imaging phenotypes, clinical diagnosis of AD, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify AD-relevant modules (ADMs) influenced by iQT-associated genetic variants. Specifically, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of amygdala density (N=1515) to identify variants associated with iQT. These variants were mapped onto a PPI network and network propagation was performed to prompt amygdala modules. The meta-GWAS of AD (N1=63,926; N2=455,267) was used to calculate MPRS to further identify AD-relevant modules (ADMs). Four modules that showed significant differences in MPRS between AD and controls were identified as ADM. Post-hoc analyses revealed that these ADMs demonstrated strong modularity, showed increased sensitivity to early stages of AD, and significantly mediated the link between ADMs and AD progression through the amygdala. Furthermore, these modules exhibited high tissue specificity within the amygdala and were enriched in AD-related biological pathways. Our MPRS-based framework bridges genetics, intermediate traits, and clinical outcomes and can be adapted for broader biomedical applications.",
  "40637118": "INTRODUCTION: We described a protected case with familial Alzheimer's disease, homozygous for apolipoprotein E3 (APOE3) Christchurch variant (ApoE3Ch), exhibiting low tau protein levels despite genetic predisposition to the disease due to presenilin (PSEN)1-E280A. We reported the loss of interaction between ApoE3Ch and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as a critical protective pathway. Here, we characterized differential interacting partners for both wild-type and Christchurch variants to identify additional protective mechanisms of ApoE3Ch. METHODS: We performed pull-down of mouse brain lysates using His-tag-ApoE3 recombinant proteins and determined interacting partners of ApoE3 via mass-spectrometry. We then performed in vitro and in vivo assays to validate the top interactors. RESULTS: We found enhanced binding of ApoE3Ch to tau and Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1, a WNT/β-catenin antagonist) that resulted in reduced tau aggregation in vitro. We demonstrated that ApoE3Ch interacts directly with Dkk1 and tau, reducing tau pathology. These findings supported the hypothesis of novel protective effects of direct ApoE3Ch interactions. HIGHLIGHTS: ⁠Apolipoprotein E3 (ApoE3) Christchurch variant (ApoE3Ch) exhibits different protein interaction profiles compared to wild-type ApoE3, as revealed by proteomic analyses and pull-down experiments. The ApoE3Ch variant alters the protein's interaction with tau, thus affecting its aggregation in a tau biosensor cell assay and the retina of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT*P301S) transgenic mice. ⁠Gene ontology and pathway analyses indicate that ApoE3Ch interactors are associated with brain-related disorders and specific upstream regulators, including MAPT, a gene encoding for tau. ⁠Protein-protein interaction studies showed increased binding of ApoE3Ch to Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), a Wnt/β-catenin pathway antagonist, as compared to ApoE3WT, thus indicating that multiple protective mechanisms are regulated by the ApoE3Ch variant Our study uncovers a novel protective effect of the ApoE3Ch variant against tau pathology, thus proposing new insights into Alzheimer's disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. © 2025 The Author(s).

  "40634788": "Patients with sepsis are at a heightened risk of long-term cognitive impairment, including neurodegenerative diseases; however, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study examines key genes associated with sepsis and Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as their potential molecular mechanisms. We downloaded the GSE135838 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and performed comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the AlzData database to identify co-expressed DEGs. Functional and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were used to identify hub genes and their associated molecular mechanisms. Animal experiments were conducted to validate the role of the central gene C5aR1 in the pathological processes of sepsis-related cognitive impairment, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and microglial activation. Co-culture experiments were performed to assess the protective effect of C5aR1 against inflammation-induced neuronal damage. In GSE135838, 25 DEGs exhibited consistent expression changes in the brain tissue of AD patients. Notably, LYZ, C5AR1, ZFP36, MPZL2, APOL4, CD163, SERPINA3, and CCL2 showed significant differential expression in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that among the 14 pathways meeting the criteria, the TNF signaling pathway demonstrated the highest significance. Key intersections of multiple GO enrichment terms included IL-6, ICAM1, CLEC4E, and PCK1. The top ten hub genes identified from the PPI network analysis included IL6, CCL2, ICAM1, CXCL1, CD163, C5AR1, SOCS3, CLEC4E, HSPB1, and HSPA1A. Pharmacological inhibition of the hub gene product C5aR1 using PMX205 improved cognitive and emotional dysfunction in CLP-induced septic mice and reduced BBB damage and microglial activation. Inhibition of C5aR1 also alleviated microglia-induced neuronal injury. In summary, the neuroimmune dysregulation caused by sepsis is correlated with potential pathological mechanisms in AD. This study provides additional molecular evidence for potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for drug intervention in the risk of AD among sepsis survivors. © 2025.

  "40631316": "BACKGROUND: Slit Guidance Ligand 2 (SLIT2) binds Roundabout (ROBO) guidance receptors to direct axon pathfinding and neuron migration during nervous system development. SLIT2 expression has previously been linked to dementia risk. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between SLIT2 expression in human vitreous humor and plasma samples and neurocognitive test scores in a cross-sectional cohort study utilizing a novel, highly-sensitive Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay for SLIT2 detection. METHODS: Seventy-nine individuals with a mean age of 55.79 ± 12.03 years underwent eye surgery with collection of vitreous humor, blood (plasma) collection, and neurocognitive assessment. Vitreous humor and plasma samples were analyzed by SLIT2 MSD electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Associations between SLIT2 levels in vitreous humor and plasma were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. RESULTS: We found up to a 7-fold higher level of SLIT2 in human vitreous humor compared to plasma. Lower vitreous SLIT2 levels were associated with a lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score and Immediate Recall Verbatim (IRV) z-score, and higher plasma SLIT2 was associated with a lower MoCA score. In multivariate analysis using single and multiple predictor models, the same significant associations were found when adjusted for age, sex, race, diabetic status, diabetic retinopathy status, glaucoma status, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. CONCLUSIONS: SLIT2 protein levels are significantly associated with MoCA score and IRV z-score in middle-aged individuals. The relationship remained significant when adjusted for demographics, co-morbidity, and APOE genotype, suggesting SLIT2 may be a sensitive biomarker for detection of mild cognitive impairment and early dementia, and warrants further studies.",
  "40628933": "Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is a central pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, with soluble trimers recognized as particularly neurotoxic species. Amentoflavone (AMF), a natural biflavonoid compound, has shown strong inhibitory effects on Aβ aggregation. However, its underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method to elucidate the interaction between AMF and Aβ peptides. Our results reveal that AMF preferentially binds to the 16KLVFFAEDV24 segment, a hydrophobic core that plays a critical role in the initiation of aggregation. It disrupts b-sheet formation through hydrophobic interactions with Leu-17, Phe-20, and Val-24. This binding stabilizes disordered coil conformations and prevents the conformational transitions required for fibril formation. Based on these findings, we performed structure-based virtual screening and identified two natural product-derived candidates with higher predicted affinity. These insights provide an atomic-level understanding of AMF's inhibitory mechanism and support the rational design of natural product-inspired inhibitors that target Aβ aggregation. © 2025.

  "40621104": "The maintenance of protein homeostasis and overall protein quality control dysfunction are associated with dementia. Cysteine string protein α (CSPα) is an endolysosomal cochaperone that facilitates the fusion of secretory and synaptic vesicles to the cell membrane. CSPα interacts with multiple proteins related to the proteostasis network and exocytic pathways and is often dysfunctional in synaptopathies. Since the initial discovery of CSPα 30 years ago, subsequent research has demonstrated a protective role of CSPα, especially in synaptic maintenance. However, the discovery of heterozygous CSPα mutations in 2011 causing adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL) shifted the back-then prevalent dogma of unique synaptic function to include an endolysosomal role for CSPα. Recently, CSPα has been involved in the exocytosis of aggregate-prone proteins through either the misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS) or unconventional secretory pathways linking the molecular mechanism of rare and common neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we propose a novel molecular and pathophysiological model of CSPα-associated dementia, outline the increasing evidence of a broader role of CSPα in neurodegeneration, propose the role of CSPα in the synaptic secretion of neurodegenerative-associated proteins, and discuss the modulation of CSPα as a molecular target for common dementias. © The Author(s) 2025.",
  "40597402": "PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of coffee consumption and caffeine intake on cognitive performance in older adults, with a particular focus on the potential mediating role of alkaline phosphatase(ALP). METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2014, involving 2,254 participants aged 60 and older. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test, Animal Fluency test, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). To establish causal relationships between coffee consumption, caffeine intake, ALP levels, and cognitive performance, we employed methodologies such as Mendelian randomization, protein quantitative trait locus analysis, and protein-protein interaction networks. RESULTS: The NHANES study revealed significant findings regarding coffee consumption and cognitive performance. Compared to non-coffee consumers, individuals consuming ≥ 480 g/day of coffee had a significantly lower odds of low CERAD scores, with an adjusted OR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.41-0.82) in the fully adjusted Model 4. Similarly, those consuming caffeinated coffee 477.9 g/day) had an OR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34-0.92). A comparison of the lowest quartile of ALP intake with the highest quartile showed an OR of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.16-2.85), indicating a negative correlation with cognitive performance. Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies suggested that increased coffee intake is associated with cognitive impairment progression, while coffee consumption may protect against Lewy body dementia (OR = 0.2365, 95% CI: 0.0582-0.9610). Additionally, coffee/caffeine intake affected serum ALP (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79-0.93) and cognitive ability (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98), both indicating protective effects. Finally, the IGFLR1 gene exhibited a moderate colocalization with ALP, suggesting potential therapeutic significance. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of a positive correlation between coffee consumption, caffeine intake, and cognitive performance in older adults, with ALP potentially contributing to this relationship. These findings underscore the importance of considering dietary factors in cognitive health management for aging populations, highlighting the need for further research to clarify the specific mechanisms involved.

  "40592398": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive syndrome characterized by cognitive dysfunction, with neuroinflammation and β-amyloid plaque deposition representing early pathological hallmarks. Activated microglia and astrocytes play pivotal roles in neuroinflammation, further exacerbating the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Calycosin, an active ingredient derived from radix astragali, binds to estrogen receptors to elicit estrogen-like effects and has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating cognitive impairment. However, the impact of calycosin on memory deficits and its underlying mechanisms in the very early stages of Alzheimer's disease remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether calycosin can ameliorate early memory loss by inhibiting microglia and astrocyte activation in the initial stages of Alzheimer's disease. To this end, we selected 3-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice and administered 20 mg/kg of calycosin daily for 90 days. Our findings revealed that calycosin administration improved long-term memory impairment, but had no significant effect on short-term learning and memory. Furthermore, calycosin reduced the number of β-amyloid plaques and alleviated neuronal loss in the cortex, although no such effect was observed in the hippocampus. Notably, calycosin did not alter the number of activated astrocytes or microglia surrounding β-amyloid plaques. Collectively, these results suggest that the improvement in long-term memory function observed with calycosin is not mediated through the inhibition of glial cell activation. These findings contribute to our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of calycosin in Alzheimer's disease and highlight the complexity of its actions in this disease.",
  "40587559": "β-Amyloid (Aβ) is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase, where BACE1 acting as the rate-limiting enzyme. Elevated BACE1 levels in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients implicate that dysregulated BACE1 expression is crucial to AD pathogenesis. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identified that the G protein subunit β5 gene (Gnb5), a component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, is significantly downregulated in both human AD patients and AD mouse models. Conditional knockout of Gnb5 in excitatory neurons resulted in cognitive impairments, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Gnb5 in the hippocampus ameliorated cognitive deficits and reduced Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Gnb5 interacts with BACE1, modulating its expression and potentially influencing Aβ generation. We further identify the first tryptophan-aspartate domain (WD domain) of Gnb5 and the Ser81 residue as crucial for this regulation. Expression of this WD domain alone is sufficient to reduce Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice, whereas a point mutation at Ser81 (S81L) abolishes this effect. Overall, our findings establish Gnb5 as a negative regulator of the BACE1-APP processing axis and unveil mechanistic insights into its role in Aβ-mediated AD pathogenesis.",
  "40586736": "Different cyclic ketones were used as substrates to synthesize tacrine derivatives to investigate their drug-like properties to identify a lead molecule for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). The studies revealed that compound 3c, a tacrine-2-carboxylic ester, binds to the catalytically active site (CAS) of AChE with a glide score of -11.49 kcal mol-1 and binding energy of -75.04 kcal mol-1. In comparison, tacrine showed a glide score of -10.59 kcal mol-1 with a binding energy of -54.05 kcal mol-1. The interaction of tacrine and its derivative at the active site of AChE involves a hydrogen bond between Tyr124 and Ser125, as well as π-π stacking and cationic interactions with Trp86. Both tacrine and compound 3c exhibit similar interactions, and protein-ligand binding heavily relies on π-π stacking interactions, which serve as an indicator of the binding enthalpy. Most of the synthesized tacrine derivatives showed a good potency of less than 100 nM. Among the 16 analogues, compounds 3c, 3f, and 3m were found to exhibit good potency of 46.8 nM, 45.9 nM and 13.6 nM, respectively, towards the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the significant binding of compound 3c with an average RMSD value of 1.36 ± 0.14 Å.

A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. METHODS: This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. RESULTS: Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. DISCUSSION: Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.",
  "40568088": "Microglia are immune cells of the brain and act as major antigen presenting cells. Antigen presentation involves the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, which is implicated in genetic risk of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. How HLA affects the function of microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disease remains unclear. Here, we investigated the HLA epitopes and their protein interactome in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs) using systematic mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics, whole-cell proteomics, affinity purification, and prediction algorithms. Our results revealed the presence of almost 7,000 peptides presented by HLA class I and II within microglia. We further showed that the immunopeptidome landscapes of iPSCs, iMGLs and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) stimulated iMGLs are all readily distinguishable. Furthermore, HLA interacts with different groups of proteins in iPSCs compared to iMGLs which involve proteins in immune response. Importantly, we detected 25 HLA epitopes derived from 15 genes associated with Alzheimer's and related dementias such as Tau, PLD3 (Alzheimer's disease), TDP-43, FUS (Frontotemporal dementia), and PARK7, VPS35 (Lewy Body dementia). We predicted 31 mutant epitopes derived from these ADRD genes that could be presented with strong interaction to HLA molecules. Along with these epitopes, we observed an enrichment of immune-related interaction proteins in microglia treated with IFNγ. These results provide evidence that aggregated and mutated proteins can interact with HLA alleles and be presented on the cell surface by microglia cells. This study sheds light on the antigen presenting and adaptive immunity mechanism within the central nervous system and its possible effects on neurodegenerative diseases.",
  "40562864": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRDs) are among the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by progressive cognitive decline driven by complex and overlapping pathological mechanisms. While amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and Lewy bodies are well-established hallmarks, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology has emerged as a critical contributor to disease progression, particularly in cases exhibiting hippocampal sclerosis and severe brain atrophy. TDP-43 pathology is defined by its cytoplasmic mislocalization, aberrant aggregation, and nuclear depletion, leading to disruptions in RNA metabolism, stress granule dynamics, and mitochondrial function. Increasing evidence suggests that TDP-43 pathology not only exacerbates neuronal degeneration but also interacts with Aβ plaques, tau tangles, and α-synuclein aggregates, compounding neurodegenerative processes and accelerating cognitive decline. Despite its growing recognition, TDP-43 pathology remains underexplored compared to other proteinopathies in AD and ADRDs, highlighting the need for further mechanistic studies and targeted therapeutic development. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of TDP-43 pathology in AD and ADRDs, with a focus on its role in disease progression. We further discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration in AD and ADRDs, emphasizing RNA dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted protein homeostasis, stress response alternations, and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport impairments. Lastly, given the significant impact on disease pathology, we review ongoing efforts to treat TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration, including antisense oligonucleotides, small-molecule inhibitors, and peptide-based interventions aimed at restoring TDP-43 function or preventing its neurotoxicity and pathological aggregation. © 2025.

Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59) is correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of tauopathy. However, whether and how TMEM59 regulates tau pathology remains unknown. METHODS: We analyzed TMEM59 levels in the brains of AD patients and the tauP301S transgenic (PS19) mice, evaluated behaviors and tauopathy-related pathologies in PS19 mice with TMEM59 haploinsufficiency, and studied the regulation of TMEM59 on chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) using biochemical analysis. RESULTS: TMEM59 levels increased in the brains of AD patients and PS19 mice at pathological stages. TMEM59 haploinsufficiency attenuated cognitive deficits and disease-related pathologies in PS19 mice. TMEM59 deficiency promoted lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A levels and CMA activity, whereas TMEM59 overexpression had the opposite effects. DISCUSSION: Our study identifies an important role of TMEM59 in regulating CMA and reveals the potential of targeting TMEM59 for tauopathy intervention. HIGHLIGHTS: Transmembrane protein 59 (TMEM59) levels increase in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients and the tauP301S transgenic (PS19) tauopathy model mice at pathological stages. TMEM59 haploinsufficiency attenuates cognitive deficits, neurodegeneration, synapse dysfunction, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and tau pathology in PS19 mice. TMEM59 interacts with lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A and heat-shock cognate 71 kDa and regulates chaperone-mediated autophagy.

  "40551140": "BACKGROUND: Variants of SORL1 have been associated with both late and early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). SORL1 encodes the sorting-related receptor with A repeat (SORLA) protein, which belongs to the VPS10 receptor family. SORLA protects against AD pathogenesis through its sorting function, and reduced SORLA levels have been consistently observed in sporadic AD. Although the importance of SORLA in AD pathogenesis is well recognized, how it can be targeted for AD treatment remains to be established, owing to the inadequate understanding of its regulation by intracellular signaling. METHODS: We employed combined biochemical, cell biological, and pharmacological approaches to investigate how SORLA trafficking and stability are regulated. Additionally, we used an AD mouse model, postmortem tissue samples, and iPSC-derived neurons to examine the functional outcomes of this regulation. RESULTS: We identified a novel direct interaction between SORLA and β-arrestin2 (βARR2), which impedes the interaction of SORLA with the retromer complex, thus reducing the retrograde trafficking of SORLA. βARR2 promotes the interaction between SORLA and the ESCRT0 complex, leading to the lysosomal localization and degradation of SORLA. We also found that PKCι/λ induces SORLA phosphorylation and enhances its interaction with βARR2, promoting SORLA degradation. Importantly, blocking PKCι/λ with auranofin disrupts the SORLA-βARR2 interaction, elevates SORLA levels, decreases amyloidogenic processing of APP, and improves cognition in the AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F AD mouse model. Furthermore, PKCι is hyperactive in human AD brains, and auranofin reduces Aβ production in AD iPSC-derived neurons through increasing SORLA levels. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals the PKCι/λ-βARR2 axis as a key molecular mechanism that disrupts SORLA retrograde trafficking and drives its degradation. Our findings represent the first evidence that SORLA levels can be pharmacologically manipulated through blocking PKCι/λ to reduce Aβ production and alleviate AD-related phenotypes. Notably, repurposing auranofin, an FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, may offer the potential for AD treatment. © 2025. The Author(s).",
  "40549157": "The ε4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is an important genetic risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, while the common pathogenic mechanism is still unclear. Impaired synaptic transmission is one of the common pathogenic features of neurodegenerative diseases. By using proteomics analysis, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, we demonstrated that APOE interacts with VAMP2, a core component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, in an APOE4 > APOE3 manner. Further in vitro and in vivo results suggest that APOE4 blocks SNARE complex assembly, which is likely driven by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), negatively regulating synaptic vesicle release. Our study shows that APOE4 negatively regulates synaptic vesicle release by blocking the soluble SNARE complex assembly. Our data shed a light on how APOE polymorphism contributes to the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, and provides a theoretical basis for the future APOE targeted treatment of neurological diseases. © 2025.

  "40542966": "Activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme elevation has been frequently observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and plays a key role in disease progression. Therefore, its inhibition is considered a crucial therapeutic step in the management of cognitive defects associated with AD. In this study, we screened a library of fungal metabolites using molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and PCA to identify metabolic compounds that effectively worked against AChE. An extensive database of 19,667 fungal metabolites was methodically filtered to identify compounds with drug-like properties that are suitable for neurological disorders. Of all metabolites, only four compounds inhibited AChE better than donepezil. Mangrovamide F was the most effective against AChE, followed by Libertellenone M, Tricholopardin A, and Aspeterreurone A (ΔG: -12.6 ± 0.2, -12.3 ± 0.2, -12.2 ± 0.2, -11.8 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, respectively). Aspeterreurone A had the highest LD50 dose (39,800 mg/kg), followed by Tricholopardin A (8350 mg/kg), Mangrovamide F (707 mg/kg), and Libertellenone M (190 mg/kg). Over the course of the 200-ns simulation, the protein in the AChE-fungal metabolite complexes stabilized and fluctuated within the permissible range. The most important residue, TRP86, in the AChE protein often interacts with all the best-hit ligands primarily through hydrophobic interactions, for the longest period with Libertellenone M, followed by Tricholopardin A, Mangrovamide F, Donepezil, and Aspeterreurone A. According to our PCA data, Mangrovamide F (44.61%) had the highest eigenvalue rank, followed by Libertellenone M (27.49%), Aspeterreurone A (23%), and Tricholopardin A (20.02%). Mangrovamide F and Tricholopardin A were found to be the best inhibitors of AChE enzyme with acceptable LD50 and have less toxicity.

  "40533815": "BACKGROUND: A proteome-wide association study (PWAS) that integrates proteomic data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data is a powerful tool for studying Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Existing PWAS analyses of AD often rely on the availability of individual-level proteomic and genetic data of a reference panel. Leveraging summary protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) reference data of multiple AD-relevant tissues is expected to improve PWAS findings of AD dementia. METHODS: We conducted PWAS by integrating publicly available summary pQTL data of three tissues including brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma, with the latest GWAS summary data of AD dementia. For each target protein per tissue, we employed our recently published OTTERS tool to obtain omnibus PWAS p-value, testing whether the genetically regulated protein abundance in the corresponding tissue is associated with AD dementia. Protein-protein interactions and enriched pathways of identified significant PWAS risk genes were analyzed by STRING. The potential causal effects of these PWAS risk genes were assessed by probabilistic Mendelian Randomization analyses. RESULTS: We identified 30 unique significant PWAS risk genes for AD dementia, including 11 for brain, 10 for CSF, and 16 for plasma tissues. Five of these were shared by at least two tissues, and gene MAPK3 was found in all three tissues. We found that 11 of these PWAS risk genes were associated with AD dementia or AD pathology traits in GWAS Catalog; 18 of these were detected by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex brain tissue; and 25 of these, including 8 out of 9 novel genes, were interconnected within a protein-protein interaction network involving the well-known AD risk gene APOE. These PWAS risk genes were enriched in immune response, glial cell proliferation, and high-density lipoprotein particle clearance pathways. Mediated causal effects were validated for 13 PWAS risk genes (43.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic mechanisms of AD dementia in brain, CSF, and plasma, and provide targets for developing new therapies.

  "40533010": "Transthyretin (TTR), a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid protein, binds amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, inhibiting their aggregation and amyloid fibril formation-key processes implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Despite its critical functions, the structural characterization of TTR remains incomplete. In this study, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was employed to identify and characterize the N-glycans on human TTR and evaluate their role in Aβ binding. A total of 18 N-glycan structures were identified, comprising high-mannose (2.1 %), hybrid (0.4 %), and complex (97.5 %) types, with a total N-glycan quantity of 0.22 pmol/pmol TTR. The N-glycan modifications included galactosylation (96.0 %), fucosylation (26.8 %), mono-sialylation (30.1 %), and bisected GlcNAc (5.5 %). Proteolytic peptide analysis revealed partial N-glycosylation at Asn-98 with an occupancy of 16.5 %. Functional assays showed that desialylation and complete deglycosylation resulted in reduced Aβ binding, as assessed by ELISA, and reduced Aβ-aggregation inhibition by thioflavin T assay, compared to intact TTR. These results indicate that, despite its low occupancy (4.9 %, with 30.1 % sialylation at the 16.5 % occupied site) at Asn-98, negatively charged sialylation plays an important role in the Aβ binding capacity of TTR. This study provides the first detailed characterization of human TTR N-glycans and highlights their essential role in the binding of TTR to Aβ.",
  "40525347": "The aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting tau aggregation or disrupting preformed fibrillar aggregates may be legitimate therapeutic approaches for AD. Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is an endogenous small molecule secreted by the adrenal medulla and can be stimulated by resistance exercise. It was proved to inhibit tau aggregation in vitro. However, atomic insights into the influence of EP on the AD-related tau remain largely unclear. In this work, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the R3-R4 (the third and fourth repeat) tau protofibril and fibril associated with AD, without and with EP molecules. The results reveal that EP can increase the structural instability and flexibility of the R3-R4 protofibril, and elicit a β-sheet-to-coil transformation and loosely-packed conformation. More importantly, EP remodels the K353-D358 salt-bridges that play a vital role in stabilizing the protofibril configuration. Binding analysis determines that EP binds with the protofibril preferentially through hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding), π-π stacking and cation-π interactions. On the other hand, EP destabilizes and may reverse a liquid-to-solid phase transition (LSPT) of the AD-related tau fibril. The binding modes of EP with the fibrils exhibit differences to those with the protofibrils. By disclosing these findings, our work provides helpful clues for drug candidate design and exercise therapy for treating AD.",
  "40524167": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with neuroinflammation playing a critical role in the secondary cell death that exacerbates the initial injury. While targeting neuroinflammation holds significant therapeutic promise, clinical trials of available anti-inflammatory agents have fallen short. 3-Mono-thiopomalidomide (3-MP), a novel immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD), was designed to curb inflammation without the adverse effects of traditional IMiDs and was evaluated across models involving neuroinflammation. METHODS: 3-MP anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated across cellular (RAW 264.7, IMG cells) and mouse studies following lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenge (for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines), and mice subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). 3-MP human cereblon binding, including neosubstrate and molecular modeling evaluation, as well as chicken teratogenicity, ex vivo mouse and human stability studies, and mouse pharmacokinetics were appraised. RESULTS: 3-MP binds human cereblon, a key protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, without triggering downstream cascades leading to thalidomide-like teratogenicity in chicken embryos. 3-MP reduces pro-inflammatory markers in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage and microglial cell cultures, and lowers pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels in plasma and brain of mice challenged with systemic LPS without lowering anti-inflammatory IL-10. 3-MP readily enters brain following systemic administration, and achieves a brain/plasma concentration ratio of 0.44-0.47. 3-MP mitigates behavioral impairments and reduces activation of astrocytes and microglia in mice challenged with CCI TBI. CONCLUSION: 3-MP represents a promising new class of thalidomide-like IMiDs with potent anti-inflammatory effects that offers potential for treating TBI and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases possessing a prominent neuroinflammatory component. © 2025.

  "40513368": "Oxidative stress, inflammation and the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway are validated to be related to depression. Theoretically, modulating Keap1 and Nrf2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) should be an effective method to activate Nrf2 for the treatment of major depressive disorders. We previously reported NXPZ-2, a 1,4-diaminonaphthalene, as a Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitor that exhibited promising effects in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. However, its pharmacokinetic properties were limited. Herein, we, for the first time, developed a series of heterocyclic substituted diaminonaphthalenes by an \"Escape from Flatland\" strategy to improve sp3 hybridized carbons. These compounds exhibited strong binding affinity for Keap1. A crystallographic analysis revealed the high-resolution (1.44 Å) binding of CD-10 with the Keap1 protein, elucidating the complexity of CD-10's binding mechanism. In an LPS-stimulated BV2 cell model, CD-10 demonstrated the best anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory potential. Furthermore, CD-10's ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier has been significantly improved. In a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model, treatment with CD-10 effectively alleviated anxiety and depressive behaviors and restored serum neurotransmitter levels by promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Overall, our findings validate that the Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitor holds promise as a preclinical candidate for the treatment of depression.",
  "40504258": "Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK), particularly MARK4, are involved in the pathological phosphorylation of tau, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases and conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. The β-carboline family, specifically Harmane, exhibits broad biological activity, including neuroprotective effects. We investigated the inhibitory potential of Harmane against MARK4 using both computational and experimental approaches. The interaction between Harmane and MARK4 was studied using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Molecular docking was carried out to understand the binding of Harmane to the binding pocket of MARK4, focusing on key interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations further assessed the stability of the MARK4-Harmane complex. Enzyme inhibition assays were conducted to assess Harmane's inhibitory potential on kinase, and a fluorescence quenching assay was complemented to validate the binding affinity of Harmane with MARK4. Molecular docking revealed that Harmane binds to the active site of MARK4, a finding supported by molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating increased stability of the MARK4-Harmane complex. Structural analysis further highlighted the specificity of this interaction. Enzyme inhibition assays estimated Harmane's IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) value as 2.72 µM against MARK4, while fluorescence spectroscopy measured a binding constant (Ka) of 0.1 × 105 M- 1. These results strengthen the idea that Harmane can be a potent MARK4 inhibitor, offering therapeutic promise for neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. © 2025.

  "40499497": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a transformative approach in cancer therapy, combining the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with targeted delivery of potent cytotoxic drugs to tumors. Discovery of novel antigens has been the hallmark for development of ADC therapeutics and MUC1 is one such oncoprotein, which has garnered renewed interest recently. The 3D1 antibody, engineered to bind specifically to the alpha 3 (α3) helix of the MUC1-C/extracellular domain, is being actively developed towards clinical translation. The study examined the conformational coupling in the residues spanning the MUC1 sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrin domain (SEA), which incorporates MUC1-C. 3D1 has been shown to be sensitive to three specific point mutations-D85E, V86A, and T88A- at the interaction surface between MUC1-C and the 3D1 antibody. Our findings reveal that D85E and T88A mutations cause significant conformational shifts and reduced binding affinity due to altered electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The V86A mutation, while maintaining the overall conformation, disrupts local hydrophobic interactions, leading to decreased binding efficiency. Further, residue 85 in the wild-type (WT) MUC1 SEA domain interacts with other residues, contributing to local frustration and destabilization. Mutants D85E, V86A, and T88A exhibited similar frustration patterns but with increased local energy, indicating reduced stability. Frustration calculations highlighted the crucial role of the α3 helix in protein stability and antibody interaction. Collectively, these data highlight the importance of specific residues contributing to the local frustration in maintaining effective antibody binding and suggest that mutations impacting these residues can significantly alter antigen binding dynamics.",
  "40495448": "AIMS: Lecanemab, an Alzheimer's disease US Food and Drug Administration-approved monoclonal antibody, was previously reported to have a high affinity against intermediately sized amyloid-β aggregates. Subsequently, it was observed by immunogold labelling that lecanemab can also bind to human type I amyloid-β fibrils. To determine whether lecanemab binds to amyloid-β fibril structures other than type I, we analysed its binding capacity to various structurally defined and pathologically relevant amyloid-β fibrils. METHODS: We performed immunogold labelling with lecanemab on extracted amyloid-β fibril preparations from six different Alzheimer´s disease mouse models whose structures were previously solved by cryo-EM and quantified the relative binding affinities of lecanemab to the different fibril polymorphs. RESULTS: Our results show that lecanemab exhibits high binding affinity to amyloid-β fibril structures that have a flexible N-terminus in common, as is the case for type I, type II and murine type III amyloid-β fibril polymorphs, which resemble or are identical to human structures observed in sporadic and familial cases of Alzheimer's disease, including a case with the Arctic (E22G) mutation. In contrast, only weak lecanemab binding was observed for murine amyloid-β fibrils with a fixed and ordered N-terminus. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may also explain the low incidence of ARIA-E with lecanemab in clinical trials. This is because human meningeal amyloid-β fibrils derived from cerebral amyloid angiopathy affected brain tissue also contain a fixed and ordered N-terminus, most likely preventing lecanemab binding. SUMMARY: Lecanemab binds to Aβ fibrils from several Alzheimer's disease tg-mice whose structures resemble the type I, type II and Arctic folds found in Alzheimer's patients, all of which share a flexible, unstructured N-terminus. Lecanemab is therefore expected to be active against all common familial and sporadic Alzheimer's cases containing these folds. Lecanemab binding ability is unaffected by and tolerates the Arctic E22G mutation, at least in type I or Arctic folds. Only weak, if any, lecanemab binding was observed to Aβ fibrils derived from tg-SwDI mice, whose structures DI1, DI2 and DI3 all share structured and fixed N-termini. Since the fixed N-termini of tg-SwDI DI1 fibrils and human meningeal Aβ40 fibrils derived from CAA-affected brain are identical, most likely preventing lecanemab binding, treatment with lecanemab may be less effective or ineffective against CAA, but may explain the reported beneficial low ARIA-E frequency with this antibody. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABBV-916 is a clinical stage human IgG1 monoclonal antibody which binds to N-terminal truncated, pyroglutamate-modified at amino acid position 3, Aβ (AβpE3). The current study characterized ABBV-916 using human tissue samples and amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. ABBV-916 selectively bound to recombinant AβpE3-42 fibrils and native amyloid plaques in unfixed AD brain tissue but did not bind targets in human CSF. ABBV-916 significantly reduced dense plaques from brain tissue that were co-cultured with hiPSC-derived phagocytes. In APPPS1-21 mice, ABBV‑916 bound plaques in a dose-dependent manner after a single intravenous injection. In addition, three months of weekly administration of ABBV-916 murine surrogate antibody significantly decreased amyloid plaques in APPPS1-21 mice. In vivo two-photon imaging revealed that the murine version of ABBV-916 inhibited the growth of the plaques in APPPS1-21 mice. ABBV-916 murine surrogate antibody recruited microglia to plaques within 24-48 hours after a single intraperitoneal injection in Cx3cr1-tdTomato/APPPS1-21 mice. Importantly, in contrast to a positive control antibody, ABBV‑916 murine precursor antibody did not cause microhemorrhage in aged APPPS1-21 mice.

  "40448625": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for ≈60-70% of all dementia cases worldwide. Microglial-mediated brain inflammation is thought to play key roles in AD progression. Clinical evidence and animal models have indicated that the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) component Listerin is involved in the development of AD. How Listerin regulates the development and progression of AD is unknown. Here, it is demonstrated that Listerin can decrease brain inflammation and alleviate AD-related cognitive impairments. Microglial-specific knockout of Listerin exhibits deteriorative cognitive symptoms based on the extracellular Amyloid-β (Aβ) or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Mechanistically, Listerin directly binds to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNA and facilitates the IRE1α-mediated cleavage and degradation of TLR4 mRNA, leading to the alleviation of TLR4-induced brain inflammation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Listerin decelerates the disease progression in the mouse model of Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration. Thus, Listerin is an important suppressor of microglia-induced brain inflammation and may be a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment. © 2025 The Author(s).

  "40441521": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by overexpression of amyloid-beta in the brain, particularly the toxic Abeta-42 form. Recent studies have identified osteocalcin, a peptide traditionally associated with bone, to modulate cognitive function in the AD brain. Osteocalcin exists in two forms: the undercarboxylated (uOC) and carboxylated (cOC) forms. This study investigates the role of uOC in modulating Abeta42 aggregation and its potential therapeutic implications for AD. Administration of uOC, but not cOC, improved both spatial learning and exploratory behavior of 5xFAD transgenic Alzheimer mice. Further investigation showed that uOC reduced the level of insoluble Abeta42 in the brain and increased the level of soluble Abeta42. There was increase in mRNA levels of CD36 in uOC treated 5xFAD transgenic brain alongside upregulation of neuroprotectants like Adipoq and Ahsg (fetuin). We explored the mechanisms underlying the influence of uOC on Aβ42 dynamics and understood that uOC interacts with Glu residues to form non-toxic early tube-like intermediates (A-O) before advancing to late mature Abeta42 fibrils. These intermediates enable Abeta42 uptake by glial cells by upregulating the cell surface expression of CD36 and reducing TNF-alpha production. Collectively, the study sheds light on the fact that uOC modulates Abeta42 dynamics and this interaction is warranted for Abeta42 uptake and clearance. The study provides a novel dimension for the treatment of amyloid disorders like AD.",
  "40441413": "Tau297-391 (dGAE) forms paired helical filaments in vitro that resemble those deposited in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue. We have previously shown that hydromethylthionine (HMT) has the ability to inhibit dGAE self-assembly at sub-stoichiometric ratios. Here, we examined two regions of tau within the core filament-forming region that possess high self-assembly propensity sequences and have explored their ability to form filaments and whether their self-assembly can be inhibited by HMT. We confirm that tau306-323 self-assembles to form filaments but that fibrillogenesis is not inhibited by HMT. Previous work by others has shown that tau350-362 (PAM4) forms assemblies that recapitulate the C-shaped structure of paired helical filaments. Here, a chiral spectral circular dichroism fingerprint shows that HMT binds to tau350-362 and we reveal that HMT inhibits assembly. We conclude that the region important for assembly and inhibition is formed by the inner C-shaped region of tau and suggest that the central region involved in filament assembly may associate with HMT to prevent self-assembly.",
  "40441366": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet current diagnostic methods remain invasive, costly, and limited in accessibility. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches to perform a multi-omics analysis, integrating proteomics and transcriptomics data to identify potential biomarkers for early AD prediction. Using multiple AD-related databases and AI-powered literature review tools, we extracted and analyzed gene expression profiles from various tissues, including brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was reconstructed to determine key hub genes using centrality analysis. Our findings revealed 13 common hub genes, including APP, YWHAE, YWHAH, SOD1, UQCRFS1, ATP5F1B, AP2M1, MMAB, INA, RPL6, HADHB, CD63, and CTNNB1, that are significantly implicated in both early and advanced AD. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis identified critical pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, metabolic pathways, and synaptic transmission, which are associated with AD progression. Additionally, nine common miRNAs and eight key molecular axes were determined, highlighting potential mechanistic links between early and advanced AD. These findings offer novel insights into AD pathophysiology and provide a foundation for developing non-invasive biomarkers for early detection. Future experimental validation of these biomarkers is essential to translate these findings into clinical applications.",
  "40438507": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is characterized by persistent neuroinflammation, where pyroptosis-an inflammatory programmed cell death mechanism-has emerged as a key pathological contributor. However, the molecular mechanisms through which pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) drive AD pathogenesis remain incompletely elucidated. METHODS: We integrated multiple transcriptomes of AD patients from the GEO database and analyzed the expression of PRGs in combined datasets. Machine learning algorithms and comprehensive bioinformatics analysis (including immune infiltration and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)) were applied to identify the hub genes. Additionally, we validated the expression patterns of these key genes using the expression data from AD mice and constructed potential regulatory networks through time series and correlation analysis. RESULTS: We identified 91 PRGs in AD using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed genes analysis. By application of the protein-protein interaction and machine learning algorithms, seven pyroptosis feature genes (CHMP2A, EGFR, FOXP3, HSP90B1, MDH1, METTL3, and PKN2) were identified. Crucially, MDH1 and PKN2 demonstrated superior performance in terms of immune cell infiltration, ROC curves, and experimental validation. Furthermore, we constructed the long non-coding RNA and mRNA (lncRNA-mRNA) regulatory network of these characteristic genes using the gene expression profiles from AD mice at varying ages, revealing the potential regulatory mechanism in AD. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of pyroptosis-related molecular signatures in AD. Seven hub genes were identified, with particular emphasis on MDH1 and PKN2. Their superior performances were validated through comprehensive bioinformatic analysis in both patient and mouse transcriptomes, as well as the experimental data. Our findings establish foundational insights into pyroptosis mechanisms in AD that may inform novel treatment strategies targeting neuroinflammatory pathways.",
  "40432382": "The aggregation and dysregulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate Aβ peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn2⁺) and a TDP-43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of Aβ peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize Aβ peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting β-sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid-state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn2⁺ induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of Aβ oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP-43 variant can form stable protein complex with Aβ40, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site-specific 13C chemical shifts of the Aβ40 oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn2⁺, Aβ42, and a TDP-43 variant, revealed that Aβ40 predominantly adopts a β1-loop-β2 motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the β1 region. In contrast, the hydrophobic residues of the β-sheet regions were structurally unaltered upon protein complex formation. © 2025 Wiley‐VCH GmbH.",
  "40431119": "Gelsemine, a naturally occurring indole alkaloid derived from plants of the Gelsemium species of the Gelsemiaceae family, has been extensively investigated for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies have demonstrated that gelsemine exerts neuroprotective effects against beta-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers, a key neurotoxic peptide implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, despite these beneficial effects, the precise molecular targets underlying gelsemine's neuroprotective actions in AD remain unidentified. Here, we employed a combination of bioinformatic, biochemical, and functional assays in neuronal models to investigate the mechanism of gelsemine's action in AD cellular models. Our findings indicate that gelsemine inhibits the activity of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), an enzyme involved in protein cross-linking with emerging roles in Aβ aggregation and neurotoxicity. Molecular modeling and biochemical analyses reveal that gelsemine interacts with the TG2 catalytic site, leading to its inhibition. Furthermore, gelsemine modulates the TG2-mediated Aβ aggregation process, thereby attenuating Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and preserving neuronal function. These findings establish TG2 as a previously unrecognized molecular target of gelsemine and underscore the potential of Gelsemium-derived alkaloids as neuroprotective agents. The modulation of TG2 activity by natural alkaloids may provide a novel therapeutic approach for mitigating Aβ toxicity and preserving neuronal function in AD.",
  "40416618": "COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, poses significant global health challenges. A key player in its pathogenesis is the nucleocapsid protein (NP), which is crucial for viral replication and assembly. While NPs from other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are known to increase inflammation and cause acute lung injury, the specific effects of the SARS-CoV-2 NP on host cells remain largely unexplored. Recent findings suggest that the NP acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that binds to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), activating NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways. This activation is particularly pronounced in severe COVID-19 cases, leading to elevated levels of soluble ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), which contribute to endothelial dysfunction and multiorgan damage. Furthermore, the NP is implicated in hyperinflammation and thrombosis-key factors in COVID-19 severity and long COVID. Its potential to bind with MASP-2 (mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2) may also be linked to persistent symptoms in long COVID patients. Understanding these mechanisms, particularly the role of the NP in thrombosis, is essential for developing targeted therapies to manage both acute and chronic effects of COVID-19 effectively. This comprehensive review aims to elucidate the multifaceted roles of the NP, highlighting its contributions to viral pathogenesis, immune evasion, and the exacerbation of thrombotic events, thereby providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the severe and long-term impacts of COVID-19. ©2025 Eltayeb et al.",
  "40414897": "BACKGROUND: Hippocampal dysfunction induced by soluble amyloid-β oligomers (oAβ) is an early neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). oAβ shifts hippocampal synaptic-plasticity induction threshold facilitating long-term depression (LTD) instead of long-term potentiation (LTP, the functional basis of memory), thereby leading to memory deficits in early AD-like amyloidosis mouse models. In this regard, the spatial distribution of the underlying synaptic-plasticity/memory proteome changes in the hippocampus, and potential sex differences, remain unknown. Here we postulated that some protein changes related to synaptic-plasticity and memory may be unique to sex and/or specific to the dorsal or ventral hippocampus -as both regions have distinct functionality and connectivity-, potentially providing sex- and spatial-specific proteomic phenotypes for early AD-amyloidosis interventions. METHODS: An innovative spatial-resolution proteomics study was performed to map whole hippocampal proteome distribution using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry. For this purpose, sixteen adult male and female mouse brains intracerebroventricularly injected with oAβ1-42/vehicle were analyzed. MALDI-imaging RapifleXTM-MALDI-TissuetyperTM TOF/TOF mass spectrometer was used, followed by traditional tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for precise protein identification on tissue. RESULTS: 34 proteins showed significant differences in expression levels due to treatment, sex, or hippocampal location among 234 peptides initially detected; and displayed significant protein-protein interaction (PPI), indicating main functional relationship to LTP/LTD pathways and memory. Thus, 14 proteins related to synaptic-plasticity and/or AD were further studied, showing that most modulated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a protein widely involved in synaptic-plasticity induction threshold regulation towards LTD. Accordingly, hippocampal GSK-3β was found to be overactivated in AD-like amyloidosis mice. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first-time specific sex-dependent synaptic-plasticity proteome changes in dorsal/ventral hippocampi that modulate GSK-3β activity. These findings provide new insight into the early amyloidosis pathogenesis in AD and offer valuable, unique proteomic phenotypes as potential biomarkers and targets for early diagnosis and therapy in both sexes. Plain Language Summary: Previous proteomic studies have shown hippocampal synaptic-plasticity proteins alterations in Alzheimer’s disease. However, the spatial distribution and sex-dependence of these proteomic changes remain unknown. We used MALDI imaging to map the spatial proteomic signatures of the dorsal and ventral hippocampi induced by early amyloidosis in male and female mice. Spatial- and sex- dependent proteome alterations were found functionally related to long-term synaptic plasticity and memory and were associated with GSK-3β overactivation, thus providing unique potential biomarkers and targets for early diagnosis and treatment. © 2025.

  "40412586": "OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic mechanisms of Rhizoma Polygonati (RP) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) were explored using network pharmacology methods and in vitro experiments for validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the main active ingredients and target proteins of RP were screened using Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and UniProt protein database. AD-related targets were predicted using the DisGeNET database. Subsequently, Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and core targets were analyzed using STRING. DAVID was utilized for GO annotation, while KEGG plug-in was employed to perform enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways. AutoDockTools were examined molecular docking. And the RP mechanism on AD was confirmed in vitro experimentation. RESULTS: Screening identified 8 active ingredients, 76 potential targets, and 3397 CE-related genes, with 58 overlapping targets. 4 target proteins were analyzed through the PPI networks. The RP and AD shared 451 GO biological process items and 150 KEGG signal pathways. Molecular docking results showed that diosgenin (Dio) had strong binding abilities to AKT1 and Caspase 3. Dio inhibited apoptosis through AKT1/Caspase 3 pathway in the glutamate-induced SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: The study revealed RP's potential mechanisms in treating AD, offering a theoretical basis for clinical use, by integrating network pharmacology with in vitro experiments.",

  "40407495": "Intrinsic disorder refers to protein regions that lack a fixed three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions, enabling conformational plasticity. This flexibility allows for diverse functions, including transient interactions, signaling, and phase separation via disorder-to-order transitions upon binding. Our study focused on investigating the role of intrinsic disorder and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the human acrosome, a sperm-specific organelle essential for fertilization. Using computational prediction models, network analysis, Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) functional assessments, and Gene Ontology, we analyzed 250 proteins within the acrosomal proteome. Our bioinformatic analysis yielded 97 proteins with high levels (>30%) of structural disorder. Further analysis of functional enrichment identified associations between disordered regions overlapping with SCOP domains and critical acrosomal processes, including vesicle trafficking, membrane fusion, and enzymatic activation. Examples of disordered SCOP domains include the PLC-like phosphodiesterase domain, the t-SNARE domain, and the P-domain of calnexin/calreticulin. Protein-protein interaction networks revealed acrosomal proteins as hubs in tightly interconnected systems, emphasizing their functional importance. LLPS propensity modeling determined that over 30% of these proteins are high-probability LLPS drivers (>60%), underscoring their role in dynamic compartmentalization. Proteins such as myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate and nuclear transition protein 2 exhibited both high LLPS propensities and high levels of structural disorder. A significant relationship (p < 0.0001, R² = 0.649) was observed between the level of intrinsic disorder and LLPS propensity, showing the role of disorder in facilitating phase separation. Overall, these findings provide insights into how intrinsic disorder and LLPS contribute to the structural adaptability and functional precision required for fertilization, with implications for understanding disorders associated with the human acrosome reaction.",
  "40400956": "BACKGROUND: Currently, sepsis has an extremely high mortality rate and no specific treatment. Mendelian Randomization (MR) can utilize genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to infer causal relationships between protein biomarkers and sepsis. We conducted a proteome-wide MR study to identify biological markers and therapeutic targets associated with sepsis. METHODS: The protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) were analyzed using two data sources: 734 proteins from Zheng et al.; and 4,907 proteins from the deCODE database. The causal relationship between the candidate proteins and sepsis was then verified by a two-sample MR analysis, colocalization analysis, and summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, transcriptome difference analysis, single-cell expression analysis, and druggability assessment were also performed to detect specific cell types and rank therapeutic targets. RESULTS: Elevated levels of CD33 [odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.05, P=0.006] and LY9 (OR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.05-1.15, P=0.01) were associated with an increased risk of sepsis, which were considered convincing evidence. CD33 is predominantly seen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and relevant related drugs are currently in development. While LY9 is predominantly seen in multiple sclerosis, but information on its related drugs is lacking. Both proteins may be potential targets for sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several protein biomarkers associated with the risk of sepsis, provided novel insights into the etiology of sepsis, and identified promising targets (CD33 and LY9) for the development of therapeutic drugs for sepsis.",
  "40400346": "The eukaryotic chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT/TRiC) is a molecular chaperone that assists protein folding in an ATP-driven manner. It consists of two stacked identical rings that are each made up of eight distinct subunits. Here, we show that the apical domains of subunits CCT3 and CCT7 from humans are strong inhibitors of tau aggregation, which is associated with several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Kinetic analyses and negative-stain electron microscopy indicate that the mechanism of inhibition of tau aggregation by the apical domains of subunits CCT3 and CCT7 differ. Aggregation of tau alone, or in the presence of the apical domain of subunit CCT7, can be described by a fragmentation model whereas in the presence of the apical domain of subunit CCT3, it fits a saturating elongation and fragmentation mechanism. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that tau interacts with different regions in the apical domains of subunits CCT3 and CCT7, in agreement with their different inhibition mechanisms. © 2025 The Author(s).

Although extensively studied in cancer and Alzheimer's disease, BIN1's critical functions in cardiac physiology and pathology represent an emerging frontier with significant therapeutic implications. This review provides a synopsis of our current understanding of BIN1's structure-function relationships, with particular emphasis on cardiac-specific isoforms and their roles in heart function. We examine how BIN1's various domains-including the membrane-curvature forming and sensing BAR domain, phosphoinositide-binding motif, and SH3 protein-protein interaction domains-orchestrate its diverse cellular functions, from t-tubule growth, microfolding, and anchoring to directed protein trafficking and complex assembly. Recent discoveries highlight BIN1's involvement in cardiac aging and disease, where both deficiency and excess of BIN1 can lead to dysfunction. Notably, BIN1 levels are reduced in heart failure while increasing significantly during cardiac aging, suggesting a bidirectional pathophysiology where both insufficient and excessive BIN1 expression can impair cardiac function. We discuss emerging evidence regarding the role of BIN1 in cardiac pathologies, offering potential therapeutic targets. Understanding BIN1's membrane-shaping capabilities and its roles in organizing excitation-contraction coupling machinery could yield novel therapeutic strategies for addressing cardiac dysfunction in various disease contexts.",
  "40388923": "The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Central to AD pathology is the production of Aβ peptides through the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) by β-secretase (BACE-1) and γ-secretase. Recent studies have shifted focus from Aβ plaque deposits to the more toxic soluble Aβ oligomers. One significant way in which Aβ peptides impair neuronal information processing is by influencing neurotransmitter receptor function. These receptors, including adrenergic, acetylcholine, dopamine, 5-HT, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, play a crucial role in regulating synaptic transmission, which underlies perceptual and cognitive functions. This review explores how Aβ interacts with these key neurotransmitter receptors and how these interactions contribute to neural dysfunction in AD. Moreover, we examine how agonists and antagonists of these receptors influence Aβ pathology, offering new perspectives on potential therapeutic strategies to curb AD progression effectively and improve patients' quality of life.",
  "40373772": "The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves temporal dynamics of microglial activation. Restoring or maintaining microglial homeostasis has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to combat AD. Transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119) is a homeostatic marker of microglia but has not been fully studied under AD pathological conditions. Here, we observed that amyloid-beta (Aβ) induced a decrease in TMEM119 expression in microglia, and TMEM119 deficiency increased AD progression in the 5×FAD mouse model. TMEM119 bound to Aβ oligomers and recruited low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, which in turn degraded TMEM119 itself. Overexpression of TMEM119 in microglia enhanced their phagocytic activity and alleviated cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice. Administration of the small molecules Kartogenin and SRI-011381, which we found enhanced TMEM119 expression, substantially promoted Aβ clearance and improved cognitive function in AD mice, even during the mid-stage of the disease. These findings identify TMEM119 as a promising therapeutic target for AD.",
  "40368227": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become virtually the sole class of histamine-2 receptor antagonists due to their greater effectiveness and general availability. However, concern has been increasing about long-term use and some possible neurological adverse effects, including a link with dementia. Several studies indicate that long-term use of PPIs can raise the risk for both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-Alzheimer's dementia, though there is opposing evidence. Neurological side effects of PPIs are cognitive impairment, neuropathies, depression, anxiety, and hallucinations. The mechanisms are unknown but could be due to PPIs crossing the BBB and interfering with neuronal function or causing systemic deficiencies, e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is essential for cognitive function, and its deficiency has been linked to dementia. PPIs also cause B12 deficiency by inhibiting gastric acid secretion, which is required for B12 absorption. B12 deficiency causes hyperhomocysteinemia, which facilitates tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, major pathological hallmarks of AD. PPIs have also been found to disrupt amyloid precursor protein processing, mitochondrial function, and neuroinflammation, further enhancing neurodegenerative processes. Experimental evidence indicates that PPIs affect brain homeostasis through inhibition of vacuolar ATPases, modulation of microglial Aβ phagocytosis, and induction of synaptic dysfunction. While the specific molecular mechanisms are unknown, findings suggest that long-term PPI exposure could contribute to neurodegeneration, especially in elderly patients. With increasing dementia prevalence, additional clinical research is needed to ascertain whether PPIs are a causative agent or a contributing factor to cognitive impairment.",

Meanwhile, the direct interactions between GLP-1RAs and Aβ and their functional consequences remain unexplored. In this study, the interactions between monomeric Aβ40/Aβ42 of GLP-1(7-37) and its several analogs (semaglutide (Sema), liraglutide (Lira), exenatide (Exen)) were studied using biolayer interferometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The quaternary structure of GLP-1RAs was investigated using dynamic light scattering. The effects of GLP-1RAs on Aβ fibrillation were assessed using the thioflavin T assay and electron microscopy. The impact of GLP-1RAs on Aβ cytotoxicity was evaluated via the MTT assay. Monomeric Aβ40 and Aβ42 directly bind to GLP-1(7-37), Sema, Lira, and Exen, with the highest affinity for Lira (the lowest estimates of equilibrium dissociation constants were 42-60 nM). GLP-1RAs are prone to oligomerization, which may affect their binding to Aβ. GLP-1(7-37) and Exen inhibit Aβ40 fibrillation, whereas Sema promotes it. GLP-1 analogs decrease Aβ cytotoxicity toward SH-SY5Y cells, while GLP-1(7-37) enhances Aβ40 cytotoxicity without affecting the cytotoxic effect of Aβ42. Overall, GLP-1RAs interact with Aβ and differentially modulate its fibrillation and cytotoxicity, suggesting the need for further studies of our observed effects in vivo.",
  "40358171": "We explored how the phosphorylation state of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) influences mitochondrial functions in cultured cortical neurons and cortical synaptic mitochondria isolated from APP-SAA KI mice, a knock-in APP mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CRMP2 phosphorylation was increased at Thr 509/514 and Ser 522 in brain cortical lysates and cultured neurons from AD mice. The basal and maximal respiration of AD neurons were decreased. Mitochondria were hyperpolarized and superoxide anion production was increased in neurons from AD mice. In isolated synaptic AD mitochondria, ADP-stimulated and DNP-stimulated respiration were decreased, whereas ADP-induced mitochondrial depolarization was reduced and prolonged. We found that CRMP2 binds to the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The increased CRMP2 phosphorylation in AD mice correlated with CRMP2 dissociation from the ANT and decreased ANT activity in AD mitochondria. On the other hand, recombinant CRMP2 (rCRMP2), added to the ANT-reconstituted proteoliposomes, increased ANT activity. A small molecule (S)-lacosamide ((S)-LCM), which binds to CRMP2 and suppresses CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 and GSK-3β, prevented CRMP2 hyperphosphorylation, rescued CRMP2 binding to the ANT, improved ANT activity, and restored the mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory responses to ADP and 2,4-dinitrophenol.

  "40347153": "Despite the relatively limited number of serotonergic neurons in humans, serotonin plays a key role in neurophysiological functions, including sleep, pain perception, learning, memory, cognition, emotion, reward, and mood regulation. Altered serotonergic neurotransmission is linked to conditions such as anxiety, depression, anorexia, migraine, insomnia, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cognitive impairments. The 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R), mainly found in brain regions involved in cognition, is a promising therapeutic target for cognitive deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly AD and schizophrenia. Preclinical studies have shown that 5-HT6R antagonists improve cognitive function. 5-HT6R interacts dynamically with an extensive intracellular protein network, regulating the localisation, trafficking, and signalling of these proteins. Proteomic and genetic studies have revealed interactions with mTOR kinase and neurofibromin, both of which are crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Fyn kinase is also associated with 5-HT6Rs, reinforcing receptor expression and G-protein coupling. Notably, the G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) interacts with 5-HT6Rs independently of agonists, enhancing receptor activity.

This function relies on long-range conformational interactions between its N-terminal (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains. Variations in SHBG levels or binding affinities alter free hormone concentrations, influencing reproductive and metabolic health. Despite its significance, the full-length SHBG structure and the conformational dynamics influencing hormone binding remain unclear. Deploying in-silico structural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and network modeling, we investigated the intramolecular structural dynamics of the full length SHBG to understand how allosteric perturbations caused by natural mutations affect hormone binding and inter-residue interactions. Raman spectroscopy and in-silico analyses show that majority of the residues in SHBG (308 residues) constitute loop regions, whereas only 21 % constitute beta sheet. Mutations in SHBG that alter its binding affinity, though distant from the ligand-binding pocket (LBP), induce long-range conformational changes. These mutations are clustered in flexible regions but maintain structural order through dense local interactions. Our in-silico analyses identified key substructures regulating allosteric interactions between mutation sites and ligand-binding residues.

  "40344319": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ), hyperphosphorylated tau, chronic neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, and synaptic dysfunction, leading to neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. Vascular proteins, including fibrinogen, extravasate into the brain, further contributing to damage and inflammation. Fibrinogen's interaction with Aβ is well-established, but how this interaction contributes to synaptic dysfunction in AD is unknown. METHODS: Organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHC) were exposed to Aβ42 oligomers, fibrinogen, or Aβ42/fibrinogen complexes. Synaptotoxicity was analyzed by Western blot. Aβ42 oligomers, fibrinogen, or their complexes were intracerebroventricularly injected into mice. Histopathological AD markers, synaptotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and vascular markers were observed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Aβ42/fibrinogen complexes led to synaptic loss, tau181 phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and BBB disruption, independent of Mac1/CD11b receptor signaling. Blocking Aβ42/fibrinogen complex formation prevented synaptotoxicity. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that the Aβ42/fibrinogen complex has a synergistic impact on hippocampal synaptotoxicity and neuroinflammation. HIGHLIGHTS: Fibrinogen binds to the central region of Aβ, forming a plasmin-resistant complex. The Aβ/fibrinogen complex induces synaptotoxicity, inflammation, and BBB disruption. Synaptotoxicity induced by the complex is independent of Mac1 receptor signaling. © 2025 The Author(s).

  "40341320": "Conventional expression studies quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript levels gene-by-gene. We recently showed that protein expression is modulated at a global scale by amino acid availability, suggesting that mRNA expression levels might be equivalently affected. Through re-analysis of public transcriptomic datasets, it was confirmed that nucleobase supply interacts with the specific demands of mRNA A + U:C + G sequence composition to shape a global profile of expression, which can be quantified as a gradient of average expression change by average composition change. In mammals, each separate organ and cell-type displays a distinct baseline profile of global expression. These profiles can shift dynamically across the circadian day and the menstrual cycle. They are also significantly distorted by viral infection, multiple complex genetic disorders (including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and autoimmune disorders), and after treatment with 115 of the 597 chemical entities analysed. These included known toxins and nucleobase analogues, but also many commonly prescribed medications such as antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors, thus revealing a new mechanism of drug action and side-effect. As well as key roles in disease susceptibility, mRNAs with extreme compositions are significantly over-represented in gene ontologies such as transcription and cell division, making these processes particularly sensitive to swings in global expression. This may permit efficient, en bloc transcriptional reprogramming of cell state through simple adjustment of nucleobase proportion and supply. It is also proposed that this mechanism helped mitigate the loss of essential amino acid synthesis in higher organisms. In summary, global expression regulation is invisible to conventional transcriptomic analysis, but its measurement allows a useful distinction between active, promoter-mediated gene expression changes and passive, cell state-dependent transcriptional competence. Linking cell metabolism directly to gene expression offers an entirely new perspective on evolution, disease aetiopathology (including gene x environment - GxE - interactions), and the nature of the pharmacological response.",
  "40340056": "The mammalian nervous system contains several cholinergic cell groups. The most extensive of these are the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (BFCN). The human BFCN are organized into four cell groups (Ch): Ch1, centered around the medial septum (Ch1-ms), Ch2 in the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (Ch2-dbv), Ch3 around the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (Ch3-dbh), and Ch4 in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ch4-nbM). The Ch4-nbM is the largest of these neuronal groups and is parcellated into sectors based on grouping of cells and anatomic landmarks. Consistent with their cholinergic phenotype, BFCN cell groups are rich in synthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and hydrolytic enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). They also have high content of nerve growth factor receptors and calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28K. In the monkey brain, each BFCN cell group has its preferred cortical targets. Ch1-ms and Ch2-dbv neurons project to the hippocampus, Ch3-dbh neurons to the olfactory bulb, and Ch4-nbM neurons to the entire cortical mantle and the amygdala. Despite extensive projections to all cortical areas, only limbic cortical components project back to the BFCN. Staining for AChE activity and ChAT immunoreactivity visualizes a plexus of cortical cholinergic axons. The highest density of cholinergic axons is found in limbic and paralimbic cortical regions, intermediate density in association cortical areas, and lowest density in primary sensory and motor regions. Acetylcholine interacts with cortical muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, each with varied regional distribution, to produce its effects. Functionally, the BFCN cell groups are implicated in several behaviors including sleep and arousal, mood and affect, and particularly attention and memory. In summary, the BFCN form a highly complex neuronal system with extensive cortical projections that influence cortical activity and cognitive function.",
  "40339619": "Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), is a well-recognized phenomenon in cancer patients who have undergone chemotherapy but the exact molecular mechanisms underpinning CRCI remain elusive. Symptoms reported by people with CRCI resemble those experienced by people with age-related neurodegenerative disorders (ARNDDs), yet no clear connection between CRCI and ARNDDs has been reported to date. The existence of shared mechanisms between these conditions offers opportunities for repurposing drugs already approved for the treatment of ARNDDs to improve symptoms of CRCI. Given that there is no available microarray or RNA-Seq data from the brains of people who have experienced CRCI, we investigated to what extent brain gene expression perturbations from validated rodent models of CRCI induced by chemotherapy compared with validated rodent models of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We utilized multiple bioinformatic analyses, including functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction network analyses, gene ontology analyses and identification of hub genes to reveal connections between comparable gene expression perturbations observed in these conditions. Collectively 165 genes overlapped between CRCI and Parkinson's disease and/or Alzheimer's disease, and 15 overlapped between all three conditions. The joint genes between Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and CRCI demonstrate an average of 83.65% nucleotide sequence similarity to human orthologues. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses suggest mechanisms involved in neural activity and inflammatory response as the key components of the studied neuropathological conditions. Accordingly, genes in which expression was comparably affected in all three condition models could be attributed to neuroinflammation, cell cycle arrest, and changes in physiological neural activity.",

  "40337551": "Osteocalcin (OCN), a small protein secreted by osteoblasts, has attracted significant attention for its role as an endocrine factor in regulating the central nervous system (CNS) via the bone-brain axis. As a critical receptor for OCN, G protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158) facilitates the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neural cells while directly influencing neurons' structural and functional plasticity, thereby modulating cognitive function. Additionally, GPR158 is involved in cellular energy metabolism and interacts with proteins such as regulators of G protein signaling 7 (RGS7), broadening the understanding of OCN's impact on neural activity. Notably, GPR158 displays region- and cell type-specific bidirectional effects under certain pathological conditions, such as tumor development and mood regulation, adding complexity to its mechanisms of action. Although the precise biological mechanisms underlying the OCN/GPR158 signaling pathway remain incompletely understood, its association with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), is becoming increasingly evident. Thus, a systematic summary of OCN/GPR158 in CNS regulation and NDs will deepen understanding of its role in brain function and support the development of new therapeutic targets and strategies.",
  "40337095": "Tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins are increasingly recognized as important regulators of autophagy under various physiological and pathological conditions. TRIM22 has been previously shown to mediate autophagosome-lysosome fusion, but its potential role in earlier stages of autophagy remained unexplored. In this study, we investigated the function of TRIM22 in autophagy initiation. Overexpression of TRIM22 increased LC3-II levels and enhanced autophagic flux without affecting mTOR and AMPK activity. We found that TRIM22 interacts with components of both the ULK1 complex and the class III PI3K complex through distinct domains, recruiting them into punctate structures that represent autophagosome formation sites. Domain mapping revealed that the SPRY domain mediates interactions with ATG13 and FIP200, while the N-terminal region interacts with ULK1 and ATG101. The B-box domain of TRIM22 was identified as crucial for its interaction with Beclin-1, a key component of the class III PI3K complex. Deletion of this domain impaired the ability of TRIM22 to assemble the class III PI3K complex and induce autophagic flux. Interestingly, competitive binding assays revealed that Beclin-1 and PLEKHM1 bind to the same region of TRIM22, suggesting a mechanism for coordinating different stages of autophagy. The Alzheimer's disease-associated TRIM22 variant R321K maintained autophagy initiation function in both cell lines and primary neurons. These findings demonstrate that TRIM22 acts as a scaffold protein to promote autophagy initiation, in addition to its previously described role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which TRIM proteins regulate multiple stages of the autophagy process. © 2025 The Author(s).

  "40332288": "It has been reported that miR-375-3p plays a critical role in numerous diseases. To elucidate its biological function, particularly its differential expression and specific mechanisms of action in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), this study comprehensively explores the associations between the target genes of miR-375-3p and both AD and SCLC. The focus is specifically on its impact on disease progression and the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. We utilized databases such as the miRNA TargetScanHuman 8.0 database and the STRING database, to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the classification and discrimination of the miR-375-3p gene, resulting in the identification of 14 intersecting target genes. Subsequently, two key genes, ASCL1 and CHD7, along with their associated genes, were further analyzed using Spearman correlation analysis. The identified key genes were then subjected to GO function annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. It was determined that pathways related to lipid metabolism, autophagy, and cell apoptosis were differentially expressed in the AD and SCLC environments, with nine related pathways identified, among which the PI3K pathway was the most prominent. Finally, we demonstrated that the expression of miR-375-3p significantly differed between the two environments, with higher expression levels observed in AD compared to SCLC. Our study confirmed that miR-375-3p can promote apoptosis, regulate lipid metabolism, influence the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. These research findings may have significant implications for the future treatment of AD and SCLC.",

Identifying hub genes associated with these processes could advance biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies.ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify key oxidative stress- and mitochondrial dysfunction-related genes in the AD hippocampus, evaluate their diagnostic potential, and explore therapeutic agents targeting these genes.MethodsWe analyzed datasets GSE48350 and GSE5281, encompassing 56 controls and 29 AD patients. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) selected genes with significance (adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |logFC| ≥ 0.5). Further studies involved immune cell infiltration, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with oxidative stress-related genes (ORGs) and mitochondrial dysfunction-related genes (MDRGs). Functional enrichment and Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were conducted. Experimental validation was done in AD mouse models, and diagnostic potential was tested using datasets GSE28146 and GSE29652. Therapeutic drugs were predicted based on hub genes.ResultsAD showed altered immune cell expression. GSEA linked DEGs to nervous system processes and neurotransmitters. 194 oxidative stress-related DEGs were enriched in neuronal death and mitochondrial processes. PPI analysis identified 24 DEGs related to both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (DEO-MDRGs), with diagnostic potential (AUC > 0.5). LASSO regression selected four DEO-MDRGs: NDUFV2, NDUFS7, OPA1, and NDUFA1. Their protein levels were reduced in AD mice with decreased mitochondrial function. These genes showed good diagnostic performance. Potential drugs, like ME-344 and metformin hydrochloride, may be useful in AD treatment.ConclusionsNDUFV2, NDUFS7, OPA1, and NDUFA1 can serve as biomarkers for AD diagnosis.",
  "40326625": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative condition of the nervous system that causes severe damage to patients' daily activities and quality of life. Amyloid beta 1-40 protein (Aβ40), which is involved in the formation of cerebral plaques, is one of the crucial biomarkers related to AD. Herein, a novel and highly sensitive immunosensor for the detection of Aβ40 is developed. Using a reinforced indium tin oxide-coated glass with a nanocomposite of gold nanoparticle-enhanced CoSn(OH)6 (AuNPs@CoSn(OH)6) to trigger the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of luminol as the sensing signal, the immunosensor is fabricated by immobilizing the Aβ40 antibody onto it. By integrating the high immune specificity, excellent conductivity and catalytic activity of the nanocomposite, the resultant immunosensor can be successfully employed to detect the target in real samples. The formation of the immune complex leads to increased steric hindrance and electron transfer resistance, which in turn causes a declined ECL output when the target Aβ40 binds to the antibody on the sensor surface. Under optimized conditions, the developed ECL immunosensor exhibits a linear response for Aβ40 ranging from 1 to 800 pg mL-1 and a low detection limit of 0.47 pg mL-1. Experimentally, it is demonstrated to be highly sensitive, specific, reproducible and stable. This work extends the application of the perovskite CoSn(OH)6 and AuNPs in the field of ECL immunosensing and provides a novel strategy for clinical research on Alzheimer's disease.",

Both membrane-bound and soluble (sTRAIL) forms of TRAIL affect innate and adaptive immune responses. We recently showed that soluble TNF binds specific members of the S100 family of multifunctional calcium-binding proteins, leading to suppression of its cytotoxic activity (Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23(24), 15,956). To test the ability of S100 proteins to affect sTRAIL functioning, we used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, intrinsic fluorescence, chemical crosslinking, molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, cytotoxicity assay, and bioinformatics to study interaction of human sTRAIL with human non-fused S100 proteins. Of the 21 S100 proteins examined, only S100P protein showed specific interaction with sTRAIL characterized by equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, reaching (0.16 ± 0.07) μM. sTRAIL monomer binds dimeric S100P strictly in the presence of Ca2+, while sTRAIL trimer interacts with S100P dimer regardless of Ca2+. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed involvement of the 'hinge' and C-terminal regions of S100P in the sTRAIL recognition, consistent with the structural modeling results. Bioinformatic analysis indicates dysregulation of TRAIL and S100P in various neoplasms. S100P lowers cytotoxicity of sTRAIL against human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells.

  "40317984": "AIMS: To explore the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and its changes in relation to cognitive decline across different cognitive status, while also examining the role of the APOE genotype in these associations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 255 individuals from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) were analysed using multivariable logistic and Cox regression to assess BMI and its variability in relation to cognitive decline. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore how APOE genotype interacts with BMI and cognitive decline. RESULTS: Compared to individuals with normal cognition and normal BMI, being underweight was associated with a higher risk of developing MCI (HR 3.065, 95% CI: [1.156-8.126]) and dementia (HR 4.057, 95% CI: [1.433-11.483]). Over the 4.07-year follow-up, 9171 individuals experienced cognitive decline. Longitudinal analysis revealed that being overweight or obese was linked to a lower risk of cognitive decline across different cognitive status, including impaired not MCI, MCI and dementia, but had no effect on those with normal cognition. Additionally, compared to stable BMI, the hazard ratios (95% CI) for developing dementia were 2.336 (2.128-2.565) and 2.338 (2.119-2.581) for annual BMI gain or loss greater than 5%. However, different APOE genotypes may influence the effect of BMI and BMI variability on cognitive decline.

  "40317721": "Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is an intrinsically disordered protein that accumulates in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Through a high-throughput screen, we recently identified 38 genes whose knockdown modulates αSyn propagation. Here, we show that, among those, TAX1BP1 regulates how αSyn interacts with lipids, and ADAMTS19 modulates how αSyn phase separates into inclusions, adding to the growing body of evidence implicating those processes in PD. Through RNA sequencing, we identify several genes that are differentially expressed after knockdown of TAX1BP1 or ADAMTS19 and carry an increased frequency of rare risk variants in patients with PD versus healthy controls. Those differentially expressed genes cluster within modules in regions of the brain that develop high degrees of αSyn pathology. We propose a model for the genetic architecture of sporadic PD: increased burden of risk variants across genetic networks dysregulates pathways underlying αSyn homeostasis and leads to pathology and neurodegeneration.",
  "40311462": "OBJECTIVE: To identify blood-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and advanced deep learning techniques. METHODS: Using scRNA-seq data from PBMCs of AD patients and cognitively normal controls, we developed a deep learning framework that integrates autoencoders, classifiers, and discriminators. This approach analyzed gene expression across various immune cell types-including T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes-by combining both differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and subtle genetic variations typically overlooked by conventional methods. Enrichment analyses were then conducted using Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG pathways, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to assess the biological relevance of the identified genes. RESULTS: Key genes, such as ZFP36L2, PNRC1, DUSP1, BTG1, YBX1, and CYBA, were identified as significant regulators of inflammation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. Their overexpression in peripheral immune cells was linked to neuroinflammation, a critical factor in AD progression. Additionally, an observed overlap between aging-associated and AD-related genes reinforced the interconnected nature of these processes. The deep learning model achieved high precision, recall, and F1-scores across T cells, B cells, and NK cells, while Random Forest classifiers effectively managed constraints in monocyte data. CONCLUSION: Combining scRNA-seq with deep learning provides a powerful non-invasive strategy for the early detection of AD by identifying novel blood-based biomarkers. This integrative approach not only enhances our understanding of immune regulation and neuroinflammatory pathways in AD but also paves the way for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
  "40305135": "Mercury (Hg) exposure is a possible risk factor for Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Some studies reported higher Hg levels in AD patients, but evidence is inconclusive. A mechanism linking Hg exposure to AD neuropathology remains to be found. The hallmark of AD brains is deposits of insoluble amyloid plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Here, we use transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and biophysical spectroscopy techniques to study in vitro interactions between inorganic Hg and pathologically relevant Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(4-40) variants and the Aβ(1-40)(H6A, H13A, H14A) mutant. For the first time, effect on Aβ aggregation of both Hg(I) and Hg(II) is compared. Hg(II) binds Aβ(1-40) with apparent binding affinity of 28±8 µM, at 20 °C in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7.3. The N-terminal His6, His13 and His14 residues are involved in binding coordination. Hg(II) binding induces structural alterations (coil-coil interactions) in Aβ monomers positioned in membrane-mimicking SDS micelles. Equimolar amounts of either Hg(I) or Hg(II) inhibit normal Aβ fibrillation by directing aggregation towards formation of large amorphous aggregates. All these structural rearrangements may be relevant for the harmful Aβ aggregation processes involved in AD brain pathology.

  "40301248": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Recent studies have revealed incontrovertible roles of astrocytes in the pathology of AD. Considering the conflicting behaviours of astrocytes in AD brain, they have been proposed to have subtypes. In this study, astrocytes from two publicly available single-nuclei transcriptome datasets were integrated to provide in-depth characterization of astrocyte subtypes in AD. Differentially expressed genes within each astrocyte subtype were analyzed by mapping them onto a human protein-protein interaction network to discover subnetworks with biologically relevant genes. Integrating single-nuclei datasets and using network-based analysis approach led to higher sensitivity in capturing AD-related genes compared to traditional approaches. One of the identified subtypes was highly representative of neurotoxic reactive astrocytes in AD. The results show that A1 reactive astrocytes could have an enhancing role for the amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangle accumulation through MAPK10, MAPT, and TMED10, which were all found to be differentially expressed in this subtype during AD in our analysis. Moreover, single-nuclei ATAC-Seq data from the same tissue was re-analyzed to evaluate astrocyte subtypes at multi-omic level. It was found that astrocyte subtypes underwent epigenetic reprogramming during AD. Potential transcription factors were also identified for the regulation of the genes that exhibited alterations in both promoter accessibility and gene expression in AD. Comparative analysis of single-nuclei RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets showed that PTN gene, which was reported to be important for AD pathology, is likely regulated by ATF3 transcription factor in subtype-specific manner in astrocytes. © 2025.

  "40296620": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by hyperphosphorylation of tau protein to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid β (Aβ) deposition to form senile plaques, and its specific regulatory mechanism remains incompletely understood. Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) play important roles in neuronal growth, differentiation, and survival, and are considered to have potential therapeutic effects in AD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of NTFs on tau protein phosphorylation in AD and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: A correlation analysis was conducted between neurotrophic factors and tau protein phosphorylation genes using bioinformatics analysis. The relationship between the candidate neurotrophic factor NRN1 and tau protein phosphorylation was validated in vivo. The effects of NRN1 on tau protein phosphorylation, neural process-related proteins, and apoptosis were explored in vitro. Subsequently, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses and PPI network were utilized to identify potential functions and pathways, as well as pinpoint core regulatory factors. Finally, the mechanism by which NRN1 affects tau protein phosphorylation was explored through Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between NRN1 and MAPT, a gene linked to tau protein phosphorylation. Western blot analysis indicated a decrease in NRN1 expression and an increase in p-tau levels in the hippocampus of AD mice. NRN1 significantly reduced the expression of p-tau in AD cell models and enhanced the expression of MAP2, a protein related to neural processes. Further, apoptosis analysis demonstrated that NRN1 significantly decreased the level of cleaved caspase-3 and elevated the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Bioinformatics analysis and PPI network construction suggested PIGU and CASP3 to play pivotal roles in NRN1 regulation of tau protein phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: NRN1 may mitigate tau protein phosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis by modulating the PIGU-CASP3 pathway in AD. This finding offers novel insights into NRN1 as a potential target for the treatment of AD.",

  "40288648": "Ebola virus (EBOV) replication is regulated by the host protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, which dephosphorylate the transcriptional cofactor of EBOV polymerase VP30. The PP1-targeting compound 1E7-03 induces VP30 phosphorylation and inhibits EBOV infection. Here, we investigate the broader role of PP1 in EBOV replication and transcription, including its interaction with nucleoprotein (NP). When EBOV-infected cells were continuously treated with 1E7-03, the NP E619K mutation was found and selected for further analysis. The NP E619K mutation moderately reduced the EBOV minigenome transcription, which was restored by the treatment with 1E7-03. Proteomics, immunoprecipitation, dimerization, split NanoBit, and colocalization analyses indicated that NP interacts with PP1 and that NP E619K mutations enhanced this binding. Treatment with 1E7-03 dissociated PP1-NP complex, but enhanced NP dimerization, which was more pronounced for NP E619K mutant. Mutation and deletion analyses pointed to several potential PP1-binding sites in NP that were located in the moderately disordered NP regions. When NP was co-expressed with VP24 and VP35, formation of EBOV capsids was impaired with NP E619K mutation. Treatment with 1E7-03 restored the capsid formation by the NP E619K mutant but inhibited capsids formed by WT NP. Our findings suggest that PP1 binds to NP and that this binding might regulate NP dimerization and capsid formation. Collectively, our results point to a new role for PP1 in EBOV replication, in which NP binding to PP1 may facilitate viral transcription by delaying capsid formation and EBOV replication.",

  "40273529": "The adapter protein KINDLIN2, encoded by the Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk factor FERMT2, was identified as a modulator of APP processing. KINDLIN2 directly interacts with APP to modulate its metabolism, and KINDLIN2 underexpression impairs long-term potentiation in an APP-dependent manner. Altogether, these data suggest that loss of KINDLIN2 could have a detrimental effect on synaptic function and promote AD pathophysiological process. In this study, we identified KINDLIN2 as a novel substrate of caspases and calpain I, two well-characterized cysteine proteases involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. These cleavages resulted in the dissociation of the F0 and F1 domains of KINDLIN2 that are necessary for it to function as an adapter protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these cleavages lead to a decrease in KINDLIN2's ability to control APP processing. Overall, these KINDLIN2 cleavages appear as potential new mechanisms in the regulation of KINDLIN2 functions at the synapse and could be of interest for the pathophysiology of AD.",

In this work, we report the isolation of antiacetylcholinesterase compounds from the methylene chloride (DCM) extract of the medical fungus Ganoderma applanatum (Pers.) Pat (Ganodermataceae). Chemical evaluation of this extract using chromatographic technics led to the isolation of a (1:1) mixture of ergosterol (1) and stellasterol (2), palmitic acid (3), ganodermanondiol (4), lucidumol B (5) and lupeol (6). Structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis such as IR, MS, 1D & 2D NMR and literature. The acetylation reaction has been performed on the mixture (1 + 2) and compound 4, leading to the obtention the mixture of 3-acetyl-ergosterol (7) and 3-acetylstellasterol (8) along with 24-acetyl-ganodermanondiol (9) respectively. Total phenolic content was determined for DCM, Ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts. To assess their antiradical scavenging potential, DPPH was used as free radical. The Inhibition power of acetylcholinesterase was evaluated in vitro using the Ellman reagent. Amongst all tested extracts, the DCM extract showed the high amount of total phenolic compounds with a value of 133.9512 mg EAG/g EX. The same extract showed a very good antiradical scavenging potential with an IC50 of 0.0021 mg/mL. The mixture (1 + 2) showed the highest antiradical scavenging activity with IC50 of 0.0770 mg/mL. The results obtained demonstrated that the acetylation has reduced the antiradical scavenging potential. Concerning the acetylcholinesterase inhibition power, the DCM extract and the mixture (1 + 2) showed a very good power with an inhibition percentage of 89%. The acetylation has also reduced the activity of the obtained derivative. The results provide insights into the potential efficacy of these compounds as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The binding interactions of the isolated and acetylated derivatives against acetylcholinesterase protein (PBP 3i6m) of Torpedo californica were studied using Autodock software.

Interestingly, TREM2 exists both in its membrane-bound form and as a soluble variant (sTREM2), that latter is generated through proteolytic shedding or alternative splicing and can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. Emerging clinical and preclinical evidence underscores the potential of TREM2 and sTREM2 as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular functions, regulatory mechanisms, and pathological implications of TREM2 and sTREM2 in AD.

  "40240578": "Despite observational studies suggesting a link between chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) and increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, the causal nature of this relationship remains uncertain due to potential confounding factors and reverse causality. We employed two-sample Mendelian Randomization (TSMR), bidirectional MR, mediation MR, drug-target MR, and colocalization analysis, along with gene set enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. TSMR assessed the causal associations between CMP and the risk of dementia and its subtypes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Bidirectional MR evaluated reverse causality, while mediation analyses identified potential mediators, focusing on neuroimaging and cognitive phenotypes. Drug-target MR investigated the role of the SLC39A8 gene, and colocalization analysis determined shared causal genetic variants. Gene set enrichment and PPI analyses elucidated the biological pathways implicated in the CMP-dementia relationship. Robust evidence established a causal relationship between chronic low back pain (LBP) and increased risk of PD, with knee osteoarthritis identified as a partial mediator, suggesting a pathway involving chronic inflammation. Bidirectional MR analysis revealed no evidence of reverse causality, further supporting the unidirectional causal link from LBP to PD. Colocalization analysis confirmed distinct genetic architectures for LBP and PD, while drug-target MR implicated the SLC39A8 gene as a potential mediator. Gene set enrichment and PPI analyses highlighted critical biological pathways, such as purine metabolism and glutamate receptor signaling. Suggestive evidence indicated potential causal links between limb pain and overall dementia, myalgia and VaD, as well as potential protective effects of Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) against AD and rheumatism against PD. This study reveals a complex causal relationship between CMP and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the robust link between LBP and PD. The findings underscore the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and inform targeted prevention and treatment strategies. © 2025. The Author(s).",

  "40234443": "Selective elimination of early pathological TAU species may be a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce the accumulation of TAU, which contributes to neurodegeneration and is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pathological hyper-phosphorylated TAU can be degraded through selective autophagy, and NDP52/CALCOCO2 is one of the autophagy receptors involved in this process. In 2021, we discovered a variant of NDP52, called NDP52GE (rs550510), that is more efficient at promoting autophagy. We here anticipate that this variant could be a powerful factor that could eliminate pathological forms of TAU better than its WT form (NDP52WT). Indeed, we provide evidence that in in vitro systems and in a Drosophila melanogaster model of TAU-induced AD, the NDP52GE variant is much more effective than the NDP52WT in reducing the accumulation of pathological forms of TAU through the autophagic process and rescues typical neurodegenerative phenotypes induced by hTAU toxicity. Mechanistically, we showed that NDP52WT and NDP52GE bind pTAU with comparable efficiency, but that NDP52GE binds the autophagic machinery (LC3C and LC3B) more efficiently than NDP52WT does, which could explain its greater efficiency in removing pTAU. Finally, by performing a genetic analysis of a cohort of 435 AD patients, we defined the NDP52GE variant as a protective factor for AD. Overall, our work highlights the variant NDP52GE as a resilience factor in AD that shows a robust effectiveness in driving pathological TAU degradation. © 2025. The Author(s).",
  "40231534": "BACKGROUND: The search for effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, has been fraught with challenges. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases globally, affecting approximately about 50 million people. Currently, drug repurposing has emerged as a promising strategy in new drug development, attracting significant attention from regulatory agencies, such as the US FDA. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of dolutegravir in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment using a novel network pharmacology approach. Specifically, it explored the interaction of dolutegravir with key molecular targets involved in AD pathology, predicted its effects on relevant biological pathways, and evaluated its viability as a new therapeutic candidate. OBJECTIVE: This study employed a network pharmacology framework to evaluate dolutegravir, an antiretroviral drug, as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, shedding light on its possible therapeutic mechanisms. METHOD: A network pharmacology approach was used to predict the drug targets of dolutegravir. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to identify interacting pathways. Additionally, protein- protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted to assess key interactions and molecular docking studies were performed to evaluate the binding affinity of dolutegravir to the predicted targets. RESULT: PPI network analysis revealed that dolutegravir interacted with several key targets, including BRAF, mTOR, MAPK1, MAPK3, NOS1, BACE1, CAPN1, CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, CHUK, IKBKB, PIK3CA, and PIK3CD. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that dolutegravir could influence amyloid-beta formation, amyloid precursor protein metabolism, and the cellular response to amyloid-beta. Molecular docking results showed the highest binding affinity of dolutegravir for PI3KCD (-8.5 kcal/mol) and MTOR (-8.7 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that dolutegravir holds significant potential in modulating key pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. These results provide a strong foundation for further investigations into the therapeutic efficacy and safety of dolutegravir in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The use of drug repurposing strategies, leveraging Dolutegravir's established pharmacological profile, offers a promising route for accelerated therapeutic development in AD.",
  "40223243": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a broad range of age-related pathologies and has been proposed as a causative factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Analysis of post-mortem brains from AD patients showed increased levels of Voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1) in the dystrophic neurites surrounding amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits, suggesting a direct association between VDAC1 and mitochondrial toxicity. VDAC1 is the most abundant pore-forming protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane and, as a channel, it plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular bioenergetics, allowing the continuous exchange of ions and metabolites (ATP/ADP, Krebs cycle intermediates) between cytosol and mitochondria. In light of this evidence, we looked into the effects of Aβ oligomers on VDAC1 functions through electrophysiological and respirometric techniques. Our findings indicate that Aβ oligomers significantly modify the conductance, voltage dependency, and kinetic features of VDAC1, as well as its slight selectivity for anions, leading to a marked preference for cations. Given that VDAC1 is mainly involved in the trafficking of charged molecules in and out of mitochondria, a general reduction of cell viability and mitochondrial respiration was detected in neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons exposed to Aβ oligomers. Interestingly, the toxic effect mediated by Aβ oligomers was counteracted by the use of NHK1, a small synthetic, cell-penetrating peptide that binds and modulates VDAC1. On these results, VDAC1 emerges as a crucial molecule in mitochondrial dysfunction in AD and as a promising pharmacological target for the development of new therapeutic avenues for this devastating neurodegenerative disease still without a cure. © 2025 The Author(s).

  "40212965": "Objective: This research focused on exploring the shared pathophysiological bases of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: The investigation into the molecular similarities between LUAD and T2DM involved querying the Gene Expression Omnibus for pertinent data. Upon pinpointing genes exhibiting differential expression, pathway enrichment analyses were executed to discern the molecular pathways shared by both conditions. In addition, GeneMANIA was employed to establish a protein interaction network, pinpointing STK26 as a critical gene. In addition, the influence of STK26 on the immune environment of the tumor was examined using tools such as the Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter to assess levels of stromal and immune cells in cancer tissues from expression profiles. Furthermore, a lung cancer cell model enriched in glucose was developed to facilitate the knockdown of STK26 using small interfering RNA. The influence of STK26 on A549 cell functionality was assessed using CCK-8, wound healing (scratch), and colony formation (cloning) assays. Results: This will help ensure accuracy and relevance in the revised version. TGF-β, HIF-1, AGE-RAGE, extracellular matrix (ECM) components and function regulation, and cell adhesion were activated in LUAD and T2DM. WGCNA identified two main modules in LUAD, three main modules in T2DM, and 44 shared genes. ClueGO and GeneMANIA analyses focused on pathways regulating cell growth and mitosis. Our analysis revealed STK26 as a central gene that exhibits elevated expression levels in tissues affected by LUAD. Elevated expression of STK26 correlates with a diminished prognosis for LUAD patients. In patients with LUAD characterized by elevated STK26 levels, gene set enrichment analysis identified a notable upregulation in numerous metabolic pathways. These include glycolysis-gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the conversion pathways between pentose and glucuronic acid, as well as the pentose phosphate pathway. Gene set variation analysis suggested that a high STK26 expression was related to glycolysis, hypoxia, MYC, oxidative phosphorylation, cell cycle, and citric acid cycle pathways. In the group exhibiting elevated levels of STK26, a marked upregulation of glycolytic pathway genes, including HK2, RPIA, IDH3G, and SORD, was noted. This upregulation indicates a correlation between STK26 expression and these pivotal glycolytic genes. MCP-counter analysis suggested that the group with a high STK26 expression level had reduced immune infiltration. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that LUAD cells thrive in a high-glucose setting, where STK26 expression notably surpasses that observed under standard conditions. In addition, suppressing STK26 using siRNA significantly curtails both the growth and movement of LUAD cells. Conclusion: The research established a shared pathogenic basis between LUAD and T2DM. TGF-β, HIF-1, AGE-RAGE, ECM components and function regulation, cell adhesion, and additional signaling pathways are intricately linked with the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying both LUAD and T2DM. Thus, STK26 may affect the development of LUAD and T2DM by regulating glucose metabolism. Suppressing STK26 in a glucose-rich setting curtailed both the expansion and mobility of LUAD cells.",
  "40209450": "Amyloidogenic protein aggregation is a hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Thioflavin T (ThT), which selectively interacts with fibrillar amyloid structures, holds significant promise for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Herein, we investigate the binding behaviour of Thioflavin T (ThT), a widely employed amyloid-specific fluorophore, with well-ordered spherical aggregates formed by dipeptides Boc-Phe-Trp-OMe (FW), Boc-Val-Trp-OMe (VW), Boc-Leu-Trp-OMe (LW) and Boc-Ile-Trp-OMe (IW). Our findings indicate that despite their non-amyloid nature, the well-ordered spherical dipeptide aggregates effectively sequester ThT molecules, enhancing fluorescence. The binding of ThT molecules to the dipeptides was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, which produced beautiful bright green-fluorescent images from the spherical structures and also with DFT studies. The apparent binding constant calculation suggests a reasonably good binding affinity between ThT and the designed dipeptide molecules, and the thermodynamic parameters analysis indicates the spontaneity of the binding process during complexation. The spherical nature of the dipeptides was confirmed by FESEM and FETEM. Circular Dichroism (CD) and Solid-state FTIR studies suggest that the dipeptides in solution coexist in multiple conformations. This study underscores the universality of ThT as a probe for fibrillar aggregate, sheds light on the broader implications of molecular recognition, and highlights the importance of investigating unexpected interactions in supramolecular chemistry and peptide-based materials.

  "40205047": "Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and have pivotal roles in neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation1,2. This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease3, and it can induce T cell exhaustion4. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer's disease. © 2025.

In this study, Amiloride hydrochloride (AM), a diuretic drug, was utilized to investigate its interaction with the DNA sequence of APOE isoforms, APOE3 and APOE4. Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) are inhibited by AM, thus making these transporters as amiloride-sensitive. Various physicochemical and molecular docking methods were employed to explore the AM binding site on the 22-mer apo3 and apo4 DNA sequences. Present study revealed that AM binds to the minor groove via vander Waals forces or H-bonding. The binding constants obtained from both the absorbance and fluorescence studies depict that AM strongly interacts with apo4 sequence. Competitive analysis with Acridine Orange and Hoechst supported the minor groove binding property of AM. Molecular docking results, including LigPlots, further supported the experimental analysis, revealing the interacting nitrogenous bases of the studied sequences.

  "40192506": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory deterioration and cognitive impairment. Bisphenol A (BPA), a common environmental pollutant, has been linked to neurotoxicity and may contribute to AD development. This study aims to uncover potential toxicological targets and molecular mechanisms of BPA-induced AD. BPA's potential neurotoxic effects were predicted using ProTox and ADMETlab. Target prediction for BPA was conducted through the STITCH and Swiss Target Prediction platforms, while AD-related targets were compiled from GeneCards, OMIM, and the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using STRING and visualized in Cytoscape, and gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. Molecular docking was employed to evaluate the binding interactions between BPA and the identified core targets. Through systematic bioinformatics analyses, 137 candidate targets for BPA-elicited AD were identified. Screening via PPI network analysis highlighted five key targets: STAT3, AKT1, INS, EGFR, and PTEN. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment revealed significant involvement in oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, neurodegenerative processes, and pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK, lipid and atherosclerosis, and AD signaling. Molecular docking simulations confirmed strong binding affinities between BPA and these core targets. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying BPA's neurotoxic effects in the context of AD and provides a foundation for further research into preventive and therapeutic strategies.

  "40186323": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Identifying therapeutic targets and interventions remains challenging. This study utilized Mendelian Randomization (MR) to investigate causal relationships between plasma proteins, lifestyle factors, and AD, along with virtual screening to identify potential drug compounds. A two-sample MR analysis assessed associations between plasma proteins, identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and AD risk. Co-localization analysis (CA) confirmed the overlap between protein expression and AD susceptibility loci, and reverse MR ruled out reverse causality. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to explore therapeutic targets, followed by virtual screening to identify small-molecule inhibitors for selected proteins. The analysis found significant associations between eight plasma proteins and AD, with five proteins (GSTP1, BIN1, Siglec-3, SERPINF2, and GRN) showing strong evidence of involvement in AD pathogenesis. Virtual screening identified six compounds as potential inhibitors of GSTP1 and four compounds as potential inhibitors of BIN1. Furthermore, MR analysis of lifestyle factors, such as dietary behaviors and smoking cessation, indicated they may influence AD risk through their effects on specific proteins. These findings offer novel insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying AD and highlight the potential of combining MR with virtual screening to identify therapeutic targets. The study also suggests that lifestyle modifications could offer alternative prevention and treatment strategies for AD.

  "40183841": "The accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) protein, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by inducing neuronal cell injury. This study investigated the specific functions of ubiquitin-specific protease 1-associated factor 1 (UAF1) in mediating the neurotoxic effects triggered on Aβ. To model AD-related neuronal injury in vitro and in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Aβ25-35 and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were utilized. Compared with control mice, UAF1 levels were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of experimental mice. In vitro experiments showed that UAF1 knockdown reduced Aβ-induced apoptosis and enhanced cell viability. Furthermore, UAF1 knockdown markedly suppressed Aβ25-35 -induced pyroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells and reduced the production of IL-1β and IL-18 through the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)/Gasdermin D pathway. Mechanistic analyses revealed that UAF1 directly binds to NLRP3 to mediate its effects. In vivo, UAF1 knockdown mitigated cognitive deficits, decreased APP expression, Aβ plaque deposition, and reduced hyperphosphorylated Tau levels.

  "40176187": "BACKGROUND: Although interactions between amyloid-beta and tau proteins have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the precise mechanisms by which these interactions contribute to disease progression are not yet fully understood. Moreover, despite the growing application of deep learning in various biomedical fields, its application in integrating networks to analyze disease mechanisms in AD research remains limited. In this study, we employed BIONIC, a deep learning-based network integration method, to integrate proteomics and protein-protein interaction data, with an aim to uncover factors that moderate the effects of the Aβ-tau interaction on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD. METHODS: Proteomic data from the ROSMAP cohort were integrated with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data using a Deep Learning-based model. Linear regression analysis was applied to histopathological and gene expression data, and mutual information was used to detect moderating factors. Statistical significance was determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Our results suggested that astrocytes and GPNMB + microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction. Based on linear regression with histopathological and gene expression data, GFAP and IBA1 levels and GPNMB gene expression positively contributed to the interaction of tau with Aβ in non-dementia cases, replicating the results of the network analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that GPNMB + microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction in early AD and therefore are a novel therapeutic target.

  "40175501": "Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) are a focus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research due to their central involvement in the response to amyloid-beta plaques. Microglial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is instrumental in the binding of fibrillary amyloid proteins, while Lyn kinase (Lyn) is a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases involved in immune signaling. Lyn is a novel, non-canonical, intracellular adaptor with diverse roles in cell-specific signaling which directly binds to TLR4 to modify its function. Lyn can be activated in response to TLR4 stimulation, leading to phosphorylation of various substrates and modulation of inflammatory and phagocytosis signaling pathways. Here, we investigated the TLR4-Lyn interaction in neuroinflammation using WT, 5XFAD, and 5XFAD x Lyn-/- mouse models by western blotting (WB), co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometric (FC) analysis. A spatial transcriptomic analysis of microglia in WT, 5XFAD, and 5XFAD x Lyn-/- mice revealed essential genes involved in neuroinflammation, Aβ phagocytosis, and neuronal damage. Finally, we explored the effects of a synthetic, TLR4-Lyn modulator protein (TLIM) through an in vitro AD model using primary murine microglia. Our WB, co-IP, IHC, and FC data show an increased, novel, direct protein-protein interaction between TLR4 and Lyn kinase in the brains of 5XFAD mice compared to WT. Furthermore, in the absence of Lyn (5XFAD x Lyn-/- mice); increased expression of protective Syk kinase was observed, enhanced microglial Aβ phagocytosis, increased astrocyte activity, decreased neuronal dystrophy, and a further increase in the cell survival signaling and protective DAM population was noted. The DAM population in 5XFAD mice which produce more inflammatory cytokines and phagocytose more Aβ were observed to express greater levels of TLR4 and Lyn. Pathway analysis comparison between WT, 5XFAD, and 5XFAD x Lyn-/- mice supported these findings via our microglial spatial transcriptomic analysis. Finally, we created an in vitro co-culture system with primary murine microglial and primary murine hippocampal cells exposed to Aβ as a model of AD. When these co-cultures were treated with our TLR4-Lyn Interaction Modulators (TLIMs), an increase in Aβ phagocytosis and a decrease in neuronal dystrophy was seen. Lyn kinase has a central role in modulating TLR4-induced inflammation and Syk-induced protection in a 5XFAD mouse model.

  "40175345": "In Alzheimer's disease, tau pathology spreads across brain regions as the disease progresses. Intracellular tau can be released and taken up by nearby neurons. We evaluated single domain anti-tau antibodies, also called VHHs, as inhibitors of tau internalization. We identified three VHH inhibitors of tau uptake: A31, H3-2, and Z70mut1. These VHHs compete with the membrane protein LRP1, a major receptor mediating neuronal uptake of tau. A31 and Z70mut1 bind to microtubule binding domain repeats, which are involved in the interaction with LRP1. VHH H3-2 is the only VHH from our library that reduces the internalization of both monomeric tau and tau fibrils. VHH H3-2 binds a C-terminal tau epitope with high affinity. Its three-dimensional structure in complex with a tau peptide reveals a unique binding mode as a VHH-swapped dimer.

However, the detailed physiological function of MDGA2 and the mechanism underlying MDGA2 deficiency-caused ASD has yet to be elucidated. Herein, we not only confirm that Mdga2 +/- mice exhibit increased excitatory synapse transmission and ASD-like behaviors, but also identify aberrant brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tyrosine kinase B (BDNF/TrkB) signaling activation in these mice. We demonstrate that MDGA2 interacts with TrkB through its memprin/A5/mu domain, thereby competing the binding of BDNF to TrkB. Both loss of MDGA2 and the ASD-associated MDGA2 V930I mutation promote the BDNF/TrkB signaling activity. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibiting the BDNF/TrkB signaling by both small molecular compound and MDGA2-derived peptide can attenuate the increase of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic activity and social deficits in MDGA2-deficient mice.

Despite significant advancements in research, effective therapies targeting both conditions remain elusive. Identifying shared molecular targets and potential therapeutic agents could offer novel treatment strategies for these disorders. METHODOLOGY: The study employs an integrative network pharmacology approach to explore the therapeutic potential of bioactive compounds from Eclipta alba, a medicinal herb known for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. A systematic methodology was adopted, starting with network pharmacology analysis using STRING and DisGeNET databases, which identified 617 common genes associated with AD and GBM. Among these, key hub genes-TP53, STAT3, AKT1, and IL6-were prioritized using Cytoscape for network visualization and analysis. RESULTS: Molecular docking studies were conducted using PyRx software to assess the binding interactions of 26 phytochemicals from Eclipta alba against the identified target genes. Luteolin exhibited the highest binding affinity to IL6 (-7.8 kcal/mol), forming stable hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. To further validate this interaction, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were performed using GROMACS, confirming the stability of the Luteolin-IL6 complex. Additionally, MM-PBSA binding energy calculations using AmberTools (-145.44 kJ/mol) provided further evidence of a strong and stable interaction. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity evaluations, conducted using SwissADME and pkCSM, highlighted luteolin's favorable drug-like properties, including good bioavailability and low toxicity. These findings suggest that luteolin may serve as a promising multi-target therapeutic agent for AD and GBM by modulating key pathological pathways.

Recent studies have shown BXD's effectiveness in mitigating memory impairment associated with AD. Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying BXD's action against AD require further exploration. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the important components of BXD in exerting anti-AD effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms using network pharmacology, metabolomics analysis, and in vitro and in vivo validation strategies. Initially, candidates for BXD's application in AD therapy were identified through extensive database searches, followed by an analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI). To elucidate BXD's therapeutic pathways in AD, we engaged in Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) assessments. Further, we delved into BXD's primary constituents through ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with Q Exactive mass spectrometry and molecular docking techniques. Finally, AD-associated Aβ42-SY5Y cells and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice models were utilized to further determine the activity and mechanisms of BXD through various molecular or phenotypic assays and metabolomics analysis. RESULTS: Our findings identified the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways as central to BXD's effects. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found the activity of BXD against AD to be mediated by the suppression of neuroinflammation and apoptosis, accompanied by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Finally, we observed robust changes in metabolite levels in the plasma of BXD-treated APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: Through systematic data analysis and experimental validation, the therapeutic advantages and fundamental molecular mechanisms of BXD in treating AD were revealed.

Here, we show that Pg also releases outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that engage and divert host cell TLR4, inflammasome, and LL-37 responses away from the microbe. We determined that Pg OMVs are enriched for C4' monophosphoryl lipid A (C4'-MPLA), an established agonist for TLR4-TRIF-IFNβ and inflammasome-IL-1β responses. Comparisons of Pg 381 and Pg 33277 stationary phase cultures revealed higher OMV production by Pg 381, which correlates with its higher proinflammatory pathogenicity. The cationic peptide, polymyxin B (PMB), which selectively binds lipid A C4'-phosphate, reduces OMV-stimulated HEK cell TLR4 activation and THP-1 cell IL-1β production, confirming the proinflammatory role for OMV-C4'-MPLA. Similar to PMB, the host defense peptide, LL-37, inhibits OMV-C4'-MPLA-dependent HEK cell TLR4 activation. PMB and LL-37 also blocked OMV-C4'-MPLA-driven TLR4 activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Finally, wild-type Pg-containing OM-NPLA is highly resistant to LL-37 antimicrobial activity, whereas the ΔlpxF mutant bacterium, retaining OM-C4'-MPLA, is killed by the peptide. In summary, Pg escapes host TLR4 signaling, inflammasome activation, and LL-37 interaction by retaining immunoevasive OM-NPLA. Moreover, Pg dispenses proinflammatory OMV-C4'-MPLA, which engages and redirects those host defenses. We suggest that OMV-C4'-MPLA triggers elevated IFNβ and IL-1β cytokines, which typify PD comorbidities, and drive PD-related alveolar bone loss. © The Author(s) 2025.

  "40123533": "Amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrillation into neurotoxic soluble oligomers and mature fibrils is mainly responsible for the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent study revealed 61% disaggregation of the pre-formed Aβ42 fibrils upon incubating with a highly soluble tryptophan-galactosylamine conjugate, WGalNAc. WGalNAc displayed no toxicity and increased the viability of SH-SY5Y cells up to 62.9 ± 2% with an EC50 value of 2.3 μM against Aβ42 pre-formed fibrils. However, the key interactions and disruptive mechanism of WGalNAc against Aβ fibrils remain elusive. Thus, mechanistic insights into the disruptive potential of WGalNAc against Aβ42 protofibrils (PDB: 5OQV) were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The molecular docking depicted a favourable binding energy (-6.60 kcal mol-1) and interaction of WGalNAc with the central hydrophobic core (CHC) region of chain A of the 5OQV protofibril. The MD simulations depicted that WGalNAc disrupted the contacts among Ala2, Phe4, Leu34, and Val36 in the hydrophobic core 1 of the 5OQV protofibril responsible for maintaining the stability of the LS-shaped 5OQV protofibril. WGalNAc binds favourably to the 5OQV protofibril (ΔGbinding = -21.76 ± 2.40 kcal mol-1) with a significant contribution from the van der Waals interaction term. Notably, the binding affinity between the neighbouring chains of the 5OQV protofibril was significantly reduced from -134.31 ± 11.12 to -121.88 ± 1.95 kcal mol-1 upon the incorporation of WGalNAc, which is consistent with the ThT kinetic results that revealed disaggregation of the pre-formed Aβ42 fibrils upon incubating with WGalNAc. The in silico ADMET properties of WGalNAc showed its ability as a promising therapeutic candidate due to its blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, extended half-life, and non-toxic profile. The MD simulations illuminated the binding interactions of WGalNAc with the 5OQV protofibril and provided mechanistic insights into the WGalNAc-mediated structural distortions in the 5OQV protofibril.",
  "40116694": "BackgroundThe data that we gathered from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction tool, FpClass, and a limited number of studies indicated that the chaperones HSP90AA1, HSPA4, STUB1/CHIP might interact with amyloid-β (Aβ) and/or tau and could subsequently be co-released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, we investigated CSF levels of HSP90AA1, HSPA4, and STUB1/CHIP in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Non-AD mild cognitive impairment (Non-AD MCI), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases.MethodsThe CSF levels of HSP90AA1, HSPA4, STUB/CHIP, and core AD biomarkers were determined by ELISA in AD (n = 90), Non-AD MCI (n = 27), FTD (n = 15), and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (n = 20) subjects.ResultsHSP90AA1 levels were significantly higher in AD cases compared to the SCI subjects. The CSF levels of STUB1/CHIP were significantly lower in AD, Non-AD MCI and FTD cases compared to the SCI subjects. STUB1/CHIP levels of FTD cases were significantly lower than all other groups. HSPA4 levels was correlated with core AD biomarkers (Aβ 1-42, p-Tau, t-Tau) regardless of disease. Non-APOE ε4 carrier FTD cases also had significantly lower STUB1/CHIP levels than other groups.ConclusionsThe STUB1/CHIP holds promise as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between SCI subjects, AD, and FTD. Furthermore, APOE might serve as an additional discriminatory factor that might be integrated with this chaperone for enhanced discrimination.",
  "40109277": "As a transmembrane protein, DPP6 modulates the function and properties of ion channels, playing a crucial role in various tissues, particularly in the brain. DPP6 interacts with potassium channel Kv4.2 (KCND2), enhancing its membrane expression and channel kinetics. Potassium ion channels are critical in progressing action potential formation and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, dysfunction of DPP6 can lead to significant health consequences. Abnormal DPP6 expression has been identified in several diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Recent research has indicated a connection between DPP6 and Alzheimer's disease as well. The most common symptoms resulting from DPP6 dysregulation are mental deficiency and muscle wastage. Notably, these symptoms do not always occur at the same time. Besides genetic factors, environmental factors also undoubtedly play a role in diseases related to DPP6 dysregulation. However, it remains unclear how the expression of DPP6 gets regulated. This review aims to summarize the associations between DPP6 and neurological diseases, offering insights as well as proposing hypotheses to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of DPP6 dysregulation.",

Transcriptomic datasets of AD and AMD were obtained from the GEO database. The shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in control and AD- and AMD-affected samples were identified. Functional enrichment analysis for DEGs was subsequently performed. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of these DEGs was established via the STRING database and hub genes of this network were identified by Cytoscape software. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed using Seurat R package to explore their expression in different cell types.ResultsDifferential analysis identified 127 shared DEGs of the two diseases, including 71 upregulated and 56 downregulated genes. Upregulated DEGs were enriched in inflammation, gliogenesis, cell apoptosis, and response to bacterial and viral infection and downregulated DEGs were enriched in mitochondrial function and energy production. PPI network and Cytoscape determined 10 hub genes, of which the NFKBIA gene was associated with the severity of both AD and AMD. Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that NFKBIA was highly expressed in microglia from disease-affected tissues.ConclusionsThe findings indicated that microglia with high NFKBIA expression were important contributors to the progression of both AD and AMD. Microglia-derived NFKBIA might serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD and AMD.",

  "40104076": "INTRODUCTION: Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema species have been found to invade the central nervous system through virulence factors, causing inflammation and influencing the host immune response. P. gingivalis interacts with astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, leading to neuroinflammation. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum may also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Interactomic hub genes, central to protein-protein interaction networks, are vulnerable to perturbations, leading to diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning can identify differentially expressed hub genes in specific conditions or diseases, providing insights into disease mechanisms and developing new therapeutic approaches. This study compares the performance of light gradient boosting and logistic regression in identifying interactomic hub genes in P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum-induced periodontitis with those in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Using the GSE222136 dataset, we analyzed differential gene expression in periodontitis and Alzheimer's disease. The GEO2R tool was used to identify differentially expressed genes under different conditions, providing insights into molecular mechanisms. Bioinformatics tools such as Cytoscape and CytoHubba were employed to create gene expression networks to identify hub genes. Logistic regression and light gradient boosting were used to predict interactomic hub genes, with outliers removed and machine learning algorithms applied. RESULTS: The data were cross-validated and divided into training and testing segments. The top hub genes identified were TNFRSF9, LZIC, TNFRSF8, SLC45A1, GPR157, and SLC25A33, which are induced by P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum and are responsible for endothelial dysfunction in brain cells. The accuracy of logistic regression and light gradient boosting was 67% and 60%, respectively. DISCUSSION: The logistic regression model demonstrated superior accuracy and balance compared to the light gradient boosting model, indicating its potential for future improvements in predicting hub genes in periodontal and Alzheimer's diseases. © 2025 Yadalam, Chatterjee, Natarajan and Ardila.",

  "40081988": "The cell surface receptor TREM2 is a key genetic risk factor and drug target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the brain, TREM2 is expressed in microglia, where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage, linked to AD risk, but the responsible protease in microglia is still unknown. Another microglial-expressed AD risk factor is catalytically inactive rhomboid 2 (iRhom2, RHBDF2), which binds to and acts as a non-catalytic subunit of the metalloprotease ADAM17. A potential role in TREM2 proteolysis is not yet known. Using microglial-like BV2 cells, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and primary murine microglia, we identify iRhom2 as a modifier of ADAM17-mediated TREM2 shedding. Loss of iRhom2 increased TREM2 in cell lysates and at the cell surface and enhanced TREM2 signaling and microglial phagocytosis of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). This study establishes ADAM17 as a physiological TREM2 protease in microglia and suggests iRhom2 as a potential drug target for modulating TREM2 proteolysis in AD. © 2025 Jocher et al.",
  "40076442": "There is still a lack of effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia and cognitive decline. Identifying reliable biomarkers and therapeutic targets is crucial for advancing AD research. In this study, we developed an aggregative multi-filter gene selection approach to identify AD biomarkers. This method integrates hub gene ranking techniques, such as degree and bottleneck, with feature selection algorithms, including Random Forest and Double Input Symmetrical Relevance, and applies ranking aggregation to improve accuracy and robustness. Five publicly available AD-related microarray datasets (GSE48350, GSE36980, GSE132903, GSE118553, and GSE5281), covering diverse brain regions like the hippocampus and frontal cortex, were analyzed, yielding 803 overlapping differentially expressed genes from 464 AD and 492 normal cases. An independent dataset (GSE109887) was used for external validation. The approach identified 50 prioritized genes, achieving an AUC of 86.8 in logistic regression on the validation dataset, highlighting their predictive value. Pathway analysis revealed involvement in critical biological processes such as synaptic vesicle cycles, neurodegeneration, and cognitive function. These findings provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for AD.",
  "40068133": "Aggregation of the tau protein into cross-β amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many other neurodegenerative disorders. Developing small molecules that bind these tau fibrils is important for the diagnosis and treatment of tauopathies. Here, we report the binding sites of a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, PI-2620, to a recombinant tau construct that adopts the C-shaped AD fold. Using solid-state NMR 13C-19F rotational-echo double-resonance (REDOR) experiments, we measured the proximity of protein residues to the fluorine atom of the ligand. These data indicate that PI-2620 binds at two main locations in the concave interior of the C-shaped structure. Molecular docking simulations constrained by these REDOR data identified five binding poses at these two locations. In addition, 2D 13C-13C correlation NMR spectra indicate that PI-2620 decreased the intensities of residues at the protofilament interfaces, indicating that the ligand disordered the filament packing. Quantitative analysis of the 19F NMR spectra indicates that PI-2620 binds these AD-fold tau fibrils with a stoichiometry of ∼20 mol %, in which 10 mol % are immobilized and the rest are mobile. These results provide experimental constraints to the interaction of this second-generation PET tracer with tau fibrils adopting the AD fold and should be useful for the development of future imaging agents with improved stoichiometry and specificity for AD tau.",
  "40055645": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, nerve loss, neurofibrillary tangles and Aβ plaques. Different process of the AD pathology present more opportunities for treatment. In addition, the holistic approaches involving network pharmacology with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may be viable options for AD treatment, and lead to an effective cure for AD in the future. Therefore, this study explored the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Rosmarinus officinalis L(rosemary) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease on basis of cell experiments, network pharmacology and molecular docking. METHODS: We performed cell experiments, to investigate the therapeutic effects of Rosmarinus officinalis L on AD in vitro using CCK8 assay, flow cytometry and TMRE Kit. In addition, carnosic acid is a major antioxidant diterpenoid in Rosmarinus officinalis L. We performed cell experiments, to investigate the neuroprotective effects of carnosic acid on AD in virto using CCK8 assay and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the main antioxidant compounds of rosemary ware collected through literature reviews, PharmMapper and Swiss Target prediction ware used to identify their potential targets. Targets of AD were obtained from Genecards and OMIM. The intersection targets of the main active components of rosemary and the therapeutic targets of Alzheimer's disease were subsequently obtained by using online Venn diagram. Protein-protein interaction, Cytoscape, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes were used to analyze potential targets and key pathways of rosemary in AD. Besides, through molecular docking, the interactions of the main active components of rosemary, and the predicted candidate targets were verified. Finally, quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to confirm the effectiveness of the genes. RESULTS: It was found that rosemary could reversed Aβ25-35 induced damage to mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells, significantly improved the viability of damaged cells, and reduced apoptosis. The results of fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33,342 and TMRE suggested that rosemary inhibited the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential levels induced by Aβ25-35, which had a specific protective effect on AD in vitro. Additionally, a main antioxidant compound in rosemary, carnosic acid, also has neuroprotective effects. Eight main antioxidant compounds of rosemary ware collected. Network pharmacology and molecular docking, revealed that rosemary plays a therapeutic role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease through the main active carnosic acid, carnosol, rosmarinol, rosmadial, genkwanin, cirsimaritin, rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid in Rosmarinus officinalis L, which affects the gene regulation of HRAS, ESR1, RHOA, IGF1, SRC, ANXA5, MMP9, MAPK14, NOS3, and PIK3R1, and participates in the PI3K-Akt, Rap1, MAPK, and estrogen signaling pathways. RT-qPCR indicated that rosemary could elevated expression of IGF1, MMP9 and decreased mRNA levels of SRC, MAPK14, compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Rosemary is an important economic plant with multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway synergistic effects.The findings highlight the effectiveness of rosemary in helping to increase cell viability and reduce apoptosis when treating mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells, thereby supporting its therapeutic potential in treating Alzheimer's disease. © 2025.

  "40043785": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are often accompanied, but there are no effective differential diagnosis and treatment for VaD. The search for common pathogenic targets or pathways connecting the two diseases is helpful to the drug development and treatment of the disease. In this study, we used gene expression array data from the GEO database to analyze common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the temporal cortex of patients with AD and VaD. AD and VaD shared 143 DEGs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed that the biological function of common DEGs was mainly related to chemical synaptic transmission, neuroactive ligand-receptor, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis showed the interaction of down- and up-regulated DEGs. The mRNA expression levels of key proteins in neuroactive ligand-receptor and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway were verified in AD and VaD mice. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test was used to detect the expression of DEGs. Data of RT-qPCR showed the mRNA level of γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 (GABBR1) was decreased in both AD and VaD. In addition, the mRNA of interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), IL-17 and IL-18 were increased. In conclusion, the shared genes in AD and VaD were verified in our study. We identified the critical genes to offer a theoretical basis for understanding the linkage of AD and VaD, which provided potential drug targets against AD and VaD.",
  "40041897": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major form of dementia in the elderly and is closely related to the toxic effects of microglia sustained activation. In AD, sustained microglial activation triggers impaired synaptic pruning, neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, and cognitive deficits. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that aberrant expression of deubiquitinating enzymes is associated with regulating microglia function. Here, we use RNA sequencing to identify a deubiquitinase YOD1 as a regulator of microglial function and AD pathology. Further study showed that YOD1 knockout significantly improved the migration, phagocytosis, and inflammatory response of microglia, thereby improving the cognitive impairment of AD model mice. Through LC-MS/MS analysis combined with Co-IP, we found that Myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), a key regulator maintaining microglia homeostasis, is an interacting protein of YOD1. Mechanistically, YOD1 binds to MYH9 and maintains its stability by removing the K48 ubiquitin chain from MYH9, thereby mediating the microglia polarization signaling pathway to mediate microglia homeostasis. Taken together, our study reveals a specific role of microglial YOD1 in mediating microglia homeostasis and AD pathology, which provides a potential strategy for targeting microglia to treat AD. © 2025 The Authors.",
  "40037416": "The Four-dimensional (spatiotemporal) Consistency of local Neural Activities (FOCA) metric was utilized to assess spontaneous whole-brain activity. Despite its application, the genetic underpinnings of FOCA alterations in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) remain largely unexplored. To elucidate these changes, we analyzed group FOCA differences in 41 MCI patients and 46 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Integrating the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we performed transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial association analyses to pinpoint genes correlating with MCI-related FOCA changes. We observed heightened FOCA in the frontal-parietal system and diminished FOCA in the temporal lobe and medium cingulate gyrus among MCI patients. These FOCA alterations were spatially linked to the expression of 384 genes, which were enriched in crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components of the cerebral cortex, as well as related pathways. These genes were specifically expressed in brain tissue and corticothalamic neurons, particularly during late cortical development. They also connected to various behavioral domains. Furthermore, these genes could form a protein-protein interaction network, supported by 34 hub genes. Our results suggest that local spatiotemporal consistency of spontaneous brain activity in MCI may stem from the complex interplay of a broad spectrum of genes with diverse functional features.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to demonstrate the association between gut microbes and AD and to further investigate the pathogenesis of microbes with a causal relationship to AD. METHODS: Mendelian randomization analyses were used to determine the significant causal relationship between gut microbes and AD. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was used to identify the hub genes. Functional enrichment analysis was used to reveal the pathogenesis theoretically between gut microbes and AD. RESULTS: In the present study, a total of 32 microbes were identified that were significantly associated with AD. Subsequently, DLGAP2, NRXN3, NEGR1, NTNAP2, MYH9, and SCN3A were identified as hub genes. The genes NRXN3, NEGR1, and NTNAP2 were enriched in the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) signaling, and the taxons of gut microbes that corresponded to these were Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Actinomycetales, and Intestinimonas massiliensis.

To investigate the molecular targets and therapeutic potential of N. jatamansi for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we used Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), ADMET analysis, network pharmacology, differential gene expression analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The STITCH database was used for network creation and protein-protein interaction analysis, while Cytoscape was used for network visualization and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology (GO) for term enrichment. Additionally, to investigate the intermolecular interactions between the active chemicals and target proteins, molecular docking experiments were conducted using the Blind docking on the Achilles server. The stability of the PS1 gene complex with Spirojatamol, was further evaluated using MD simulations. With Spirojatamol showing the highest binding energy scores against PS1 (-6.9 kcal/mol), molecular docking confirmed the activity of this metabolite against AD targets PS1 and Spirojatamol formed a stable complex at 100 nanoseconds, according to additional investigation using MD simulations. Significant ligand-protein interactions were verified by binding free energy calculations using the MM/GBSA technique. The PS1-Spirojatamol complex had a binding energy of ΔG: -36.95 ± 5.00 kcal/mol.

  "40001482": "Ginseng, a traditional herbal medicine with a long history of use, is known to support human health, particularly by influencing brain function. Recent studies have identified gintonin, a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand derived from ginseng, as a key bioactive. However, the specific LPA receptor subtypes targeted by gintonin in the human brain to exert its anti-Alzheimer's (AD) effects remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the LPA receptor subtype targeted by gintonin in the human cortex. Using a fluorescent gintonin conjugate, we investigated receptor binding in cortical samples from healthy individuals (n = 4) and AD patients (n = 4). Our results demonstrated that fluorescent gintonin selectively binds to human cortical neurons rather than glial cells and that gintonin-binding sites are co-localized with the LPA4 receptor subtype. Furthermore, the expression of LPA4 receptors was significantly reduced in the cortical neurons of AD patients. These results suggest that the LPA4 receptor may serve as a novel histopathological marker for AD and represent a promising therapeutic target for gintonin-based prevention and treatment strategies.",
  "39998604": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and increasing societal problem due to the extending human lifespan. In males, loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in leukocytes is strongly associated with AD. We studied here DNA methylation and RNA expression in sorted monocytes and granulocytes with and without LOY from male AD patients. Through multi-omic analysis, we identified new candidate genes along with those previously associated with AD. Global analyses of DNA methylation in samples with LOY vs. normal state showed that hypomethylation dominated both in granulocytes and monocytes. Our findings highlight LOY-related differences in DNA methylation that occur in gene regulatory regions. Specifically, we observed alterations in key genes involved in leukocyte differentiation: FLI1, involved in early hematopoiesis; RUNX1, essential for blood cell development; RARA, regulating gene expression in response to retinoic acid; CANX, crucial for protein folding; CEBPB, a transcription factor important for immune responses; and MYADM, implicated in cell adhesion and migration. Moreover, protein-protein interaction analysis in granulocytes identified that products of two of these genes, CANX and CEBPB, are key hub proteins. This research underscores the potential of multi-omic approach in pure hematopoietic cell populations to uncover the molecular underpinnings of AD.

Akt and Wnt play a role in complex cellular signaling, which is crucial for examining the onset of AD. In this study, we aimed to identify and analyze Akt pathway-related genes (ARGs) and Wnt pathway-related genes (WRGs) as AD biomarkers, determine the effects of ARGs and WRGs on AD, and verify these effects in AD mouse models. We searched for differentially expressed genes in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, constructed candidate gene protein-protein interaction networks, and used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis and the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination algorithm to screen key genes. Correlation and functional similarity analyses of key genes, immune infiltration analysis, competing endogenous RNA network construction, and drug prediction of key genes were performed. Expression of key genes in streptozotocin-treated (STZ)-treated AD mice was validated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Bioinformatics analysis identified five key genes in AD: PRKACA, CDH3, ATP6V0C, DLL1, and CELSR2. Step-down tests, immunohistochemistry, and silver plate staining confirmed successful treatment of STZ-induced AD in mice. According to RT-qPCR analysis, the relative expression of DLL1 mRNA in AD mice was higher than that in control mice, whereas the relative expression of ATP6V0C and PRKACA mRNA in AD mice was lower than that in control mice; this was consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis (p < 0.05).

  "39989971": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses as a continuum, from preclinical stages to late-stage cognitive decline, yet the molecular mechanisms driving this progression remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a systems-level map of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network dysfunction across the AD spectrum and uncover epichaperomes-stable scaffolding platforms formed by chaperones and co-factors-as central drivers of this process. Using over 100 human brain specimens, mouse models, and human neurons, we show that epichaperomes emerge early, even in preclinical AD, and progressively disrupt multiple PPI networks critical for synaptic function and neuroplasticity. Glutamatergic neurons, essential for learning and memory, exhibit heightened vulnerability, with their dysfunction driven by protein sequestration into epichaperome scaffolds, independent of changes in protein expression. Notably, pharmacological disruption of epichaperomes with PU-AD restores PPI network integrity and reverses synaptic and cognitive deficits, directly linking epichaperome-driven network dysfunction to AD pathology. These findings establish epichaperomes as key mediators of molecular collapse in AD and identify network-centric intervention strategies as a promising avenue for disease-modifying therapies.",

Despite strong evidence supporting that both astrocytes and apolipoprotein E (APOE) play crucial roles in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the impact of astrocytes carrying different APOE variants on key AD pathological hallmarks remains largely unknown. To explore such effects in a human relevant context, we generated a chimeric model of AD. We transplanted isogenic APOE3 or APOE4 human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocyte progenitors into neonatal brains of AD model mice. We show that at five to six months after transplantation, transplanted cells have differentiated into mature astrocytes (h-astrocytes) that often integrate in upper layers of one cortical hemisphere. APOE3 and APOE4 h-astrocytes differentially express and secrete the APOE protein, which binds to Aβ plaques with an isoform-dependent affinity. Remarkably, APOE3 h-astrocytes ameliorate Aβ pathology, Tau pathology and neuritic dystrophy. In contrast, APOE4 h-astrocytes aggravate these AD processes. Moreover, APOE3 and APOE4 h-astrocytes modulate microglia responses to Aβ pathology in opposite ways. APOE4 h-astrocytes enhance microglia clustering around Aβ plaques and exacerbate DAM state whereas APOE3 h-astrocytes reduce microglia clustering and induce a more homeostatic state on plaque-associated microglia. These findings highlight a critical contribution of h-astrocytes not only to Aβ pathology but also to other key AD hallmarks in chimeric mice. In addition, our findings reveal that h-astrocytes with different APOE variants and the different forms of APOE they secrete have a crucial role in AD progression.",

Popova S, Bhattarai P, Yilmaz E, Lascu D, Kuo JH, Erdem G, Coban B, Michling J, Cosacak MI, Tayran H, Kurth T, Schambony A, Buchholz F, Gentzel M, Kizil C. Microproteins, short functional peptides encoded by small genes, are emerging as critical regulators of cellular processes, yet their roles in mitochondrial function and neurodegeneration remain underexplored. In this study, we identify NCBP2-AS2 as an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial microprotein with significant roles in energy metabolism and neurogenesis. Using a combination of cellular and molecular approaches, including CRISPR/Cas9 knockout models, stoichiometric co- immunoprecipitation, and advanced imaging techniques, we demonstrate that NCBP2-AS2 localizes to the inner mitochondrial space and interacts with translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) chaperones. These interactions suggest a role in ATPase subunit transport, supported by the observed reductions in ATPase subunit levels and impaired glucose metabolism in NCBP2-AS2-deficient cells. In zebrafish, NCBP2-AS2 knockout led to increased astroglial proliferation, microglial abundance, and enhanced neurogenesis, particularly under amyloid pathology. Notably, we show that NCBP2-AS2 expression is consistently downregulated in human Alzheimer's disease brains and zebrafish amyloidosis models, suggesting a conserved role in neurodegenerative pathology. These findings reveal a novel link between mitochondrial protein transport, energy metabolism, and neural regeneration, positioning NCBP2-AS2 as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction and promoting neurogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",
  "39974060": "Neurodegenerative diseases share common features of protein aggregation along with other pleiotropic traits, including shifts in transcriptional patterns, neuroinflammation, disruptions in synaptic signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired clearance mechanisms like autophagy. However, key regulators of these pleotropic traits have yet to be identified. Here, we discovered a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), FAM151B-DT, that is reduced in a stem cell model of frontotemporal dementia with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and in brains from FTLD-tau, progressive supranuclear palsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease patients. We show that silencing FAM151B-DT in vitro is sufficient to enhance tau aggregation. To begin to understand the mechanism by which FAM151B-DT mediates tau aggregation and contributes to several neurodegenerative diseases, we deeply characterized this novel lncRNA and found that FAM151B-DT resides in the cytoplasm where it interacts with tau, α-synuclein, HSC70, and other proteins enriched in protein homeostasis. When silenced, FAM151B-DT blocks autophagy, leading to the accumulation of tau and α-synuclein. Importantly, we discovered that increasing FAM151B-DT expression is sufficient to promote autophagic flux, reduce phospho-tau and α-synuclein, and reduce tau aggregation. Overall, these findings pave the way for further exploration of FAM151B-DT as a promising molecular target for several neurodegenerative diseases.",
  "39970859": "BACKGROUND: Excessive activation of microglia triggers pro-inflammatory responses, exacerbating neuronal damage and accelerating the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, targeting abnormal microglial activation represents a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. In this study, we identified sclareol (SCL) through compound library screening as a potent anti-inflammatory agent capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. However, there are currently no reports on whether SCL modulates microglial inflammation or ameliorates AD pathology. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying molecular mechanism of SCL on microglial-mediated inflammation and neuronal damage in AD. METHODS: Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS), Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), protein interaction assays, Biolayer Interferometry (BLI), and molecular docking were used to explore the interaction between SCL and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9). Behavioral tests and immunofluorescent (IF) staining were performed to assess the effects of SCL on microglial activation and AD pathology. The molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of SCL was analyzed by interfering with CDK9. RESULTS: SCL significantly inhibited the release of proinflammatory mediators, reduced neuronal damage, and alleviated cognitive deficits in AD model mice. Notably, SCL demonstrated the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), highlighting its therapeutic potential. Mechanistically, SCL binds directly to CDK9, which contributes to the inflammatory response through its interaction with NF-κB. Knockdown of CDK9 reduced the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response, but did not have an additive effect on SCL, indicating that SCL's efficacy is mediated by CDK9 inhibition and subsequent suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that SCL exerts neuroprotective effects in AD mice by targeting CDK9 and downstream NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce the inflammatory activation of microglia. These findings suggest that SCL is a promising candidate for the treatment of AD, offering a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate disease progression through modulation of microglial activation.",

METHODS: Through detailed analysis of glioma single-cell data, we found that gene expression patterns are closely related to cell types and states. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and dimensionality reduction techniques like UMAP and t-SNE reveal cell population heterogeneity and potential subgroups. This research also involved building machine learning models to classify glioma and assessing their performances, as well as a model that can best classify each type.. RESULTS: We investigated these cell interaction networks along with NRG signaling networks for glioma to discern cell-cell communication and signaling events. The SPP1 signaling pathway and gene expression analysis further triage the specific genes mediating the interactive role in glioma cells.

  "39955064": "The trafficking and aggregation of neurodegenerative proteins often involve the interaction between intrinsically disordered domains, stabilized by the inclusion of physiological metal ions such as copper or zinc. Characterizing the metal ion coordination environment is critical for assessing the stability and organization of these relevant protein-protein interactions but is challenging given the lack of regular molecular order or global structure. The cellular prion protein (PrPC) binds both monomers and aggregates of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Aβ), promoting Aβ internalization and aberrant signaling, respectively. Both proteins bind Cu2+ with high affinity, opening the potential for copper to form an intermolecular bridge. We describe here a novel approach utilizing multiple EPR experiments to investigate the simultaneous Cu2+ coordination of PrPC and Aβ in a 1:1:1 mixture. Uniformly 15N-labeled PrPC is used in conjunction with natural abundance 14N Aβ, the combination of which leads to distinct energy manifolds for paramagnetic Cu2+ and is resolved by the pulsed EPR experiments ESEEM and HYSCORE. We develop acquisition parameters to simultaneously optimize 14N (I = 1) and 15N (I = ½) pulsed EPR signals and we also advance the theory of ESEEM and HYSCORE to quantitatively describe multiple 15N imidazole coordination. This unique approach provides compelling evidence of a copper-stabilized ternary complex, with equatorial Cu2+ coordination formed by one histidine imidazole from Aβ and three from PrP. Moreover, the methodologies developed here provide a framework for assessing the copper environment in other interacting neurodegenerative proteins.",
  "39952508": "GFM1 is a nuclear gene that plays a role in mitochondrial function. In recent decades, various homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations have been identified, leading to significant health issues in patients and often resulting in early death. There is a few experimental research on this gene, particularly regarding its pathogenicity through in silico methods and RNA sequencing and experimental validation in GFM1 knockout cells. This study aims to explore how high-risk pathogenic variants affect protein stability and function using a comprehensive bioinformatics approach. Analyses with Align-GVGD, PolyPhen-2, MupRo, and SIFT indicated that most variants are likely to be highly pathogenic and destabilize the protein structure. The variants were consistently classified as high-risk by Align-GVGD and were deemed \"probably damaging\" or \"possibly damaging\" by PolyPhen-2. MupRo analysis suggested a reduction in protein stability, while SIFT indicated functional impacts for all variants. Further analysis with MetaRNN and structural assessments showed that these variants affect protein size, charge, and hydrophobicity, which may disrupt inter-domain interactions and hinder protein function. Differential gene expression analysis in GFM1 knockout HK2 and 293 T cells revealed significant changes in gene expression, particularly in areas related to translation, mitochondrial function, and cellular responses. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the affected genes are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and various signaling pathways. GFM1 knockout cells displayed notable pathway changes, including those related to oxidative phosphorylation and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's). Upregulation of mitochondrial electron transport chain components (COX17, NDUFB1, ATP5MC1) suggests a compensatory mechanism in response to impaired mitochondrial function. Disruptions in proteostasis and protein synthesis were highlighted by dysregulated proteasome and ribosomal pathways. Markers of mitophagy, such as increased HSP90 and decreased TOMM20 levels, along with changes in PINK1 protein, emphasize GFM1's involvement in mitophagy. Protein-protein interaction analysis connected GFM1 to key mitophagy proteins (e.g., OPTN, Park2/Parkin). Functional experiments confirmed increased mitophagy, indicating a protective response. These results highlight the negative impact of high-risk pathogenic variants on protein stability and cellular function, shedding light on their potential roles in disease progression. This study offers valuable insights into the pathogenic mechanisms linked to GFM1 mutations, underscoring its critical role in mitochondrial function and cellular balance. The findings highlight the gene's involvement in mitophagy, oxidative phosphorylation, and neurodegenerative pathways, laying the groundwork for future research into therapeutic approaches targeting GFM1-related dysfunctions.",

  "39937575": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are present in diverse molecular complexes where they function as dynamic regulators. Their characteristics promote liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the formation of membraneless organelles such as stress granules and nucleoli. IDR-RBPs are particularly relevant in the nervous system and their dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumor development. Serpine1 mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) is a unique member of this group, being mostly disordered and lacking canonical RNA-binding domains. We defined SERBP1's interactome, uncovered novel roles in splicing, cell division and ribosomal biogenesis, and showed its participation in pathological stress granules and Tau aggregates in Alzheimer's brains. SERBP1 preferentially interacts with other G-quadruplex (G4) binders, implicated in different stages of gene expression, suggesting that G4 binding is a critical component of SERBP1 function in different settings. Similarly, we identified important associations between SERBP1 and PARP1/polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation). SERBP1 interacts with PARP1 and its associated factors and influences PARylation. Moreover, protein complexes in which SERBP1 participates contain mostly PARylated proteins and PAR binders. Based on these results, we propose a feedback regulatory model in which SERBP1 influences PARP1 function and PARylation, while PARylation modulates SERBP1 functions and participation in regulatory complexes. © 2024, Breunig, Lei, Montalbano et al.",

Six-month-old amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1(APP/PS1) mice were selected and divided into the APP/PS1 group and Jiawei Xionggui Decoction intervention group, with age-matched C57BL/6 mice serving as controls. Cognitive abilities and pathological damage in the mice were observed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry(GC-MS/MS) technology was utilized to analyze the metabolic profiles of mice brain tissue. Differential metabolites were screened, and relevant metabolic pathways were enriched. Network pharmacology was adopted to screen the active components of Jiawei Xionggui Decoction, so as to construct a protein-protein interaction network of its core targets for AD treatment and conduct Gene Ontology(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) enrichment analysis of potential targets for Jiawei Xionggui Decoction in treating AD. Finally, a &quot;metabolite-reaction-enzyme-gene&quot; network was constructed for combined analysis of metabolomics and network pharmacology. The results showed that Jiawei Xionggui Decoction significantly reversed the trends of 18 differential metabolites involved in 15 metabolic pathways such as glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle(TCA) in mouse brain tissue. Furthermore, 383 core targets of Jiawei Xionggui Decoction were implicated in pathways like the phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/protein kinase B(Akt) signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway. Overall analysis indicated that energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism were crucial metabolic pathways for Jiawei Xionggui Decoction in treating AD. The findings suggest that Jiawei Xionggui Decoction can protect neuronal cells in mouse brain tissue, thus improving cognitive impairment.",
  "39928227": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slow brain degeneration disorder in which the accumulation of beta-amyloid precursor plaque and an intracellular neurofibrillary tangle of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins in the brain have been implicated in neurodegeneration. In this study, we identified the most important genes that are unique and sensitive in the entorhinal region of the brain to target AD effectively. At first, microarrays data are selected and constructed protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) and gene regulatory network (GRN) from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Cytoscape software. Then, networks analysis was performed to determine hubs, bottlenecks, clusters, and signaling pathways in AD. Finally, critical genes were selected as targets for repurposing drugs. Analyzing the constructed PPIN and GRN identified CD44, ELF1, HSP90AB1, NOC4L, BYSL, RRP7A, SLC17A6, and RUVBL2 as critical genes that are dysregulated in the entorhinal region of AD suffering patients. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEG nodes are involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle, glutamatergic synapse, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, and nicotine addiction. Gentamicin, isoproterenol, and tumor necrosis factor are repurposing new drugs that target CD44, which plays an important role in the development of AD.

  "39920775": "BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to progressive paralysis. Both genetic alterations and epigenetic modifications contribute to neuronal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ALS. However, the mechanism behind genetic mutations in the non-coding region of genes that affect epigenetic modifications remains unclear. METHODS: Convolutional neural network was used to identify an ALS-associated SNP located in the intronic region of MEF2C (rs304152), residing in a putative enhancer element. To examine the alteration of MEF2C transcription by the SNP, we generated HEK293T cells carrying the major or minor allele by CRISPR-Cas9. To verify the role of MEF2C-knockdown (MEF2C-KD) in mice, we developed AAV expressing shRNA for MEF2C based on AAV-U6 promoter vector. Neuropathological alterations of MEF2C-KD mice with mitochondrial dysfunction and motor neuronal damage were observed by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Behavioral changes of mice were examined through longitudinal study by tail suspension, inverted grid test and automated gait analysis. RESULTS: Here, we show that enhancer mutation of MEF2C reduces own gene expression and consequently impairs mitochondrial function in motor neurons. MEF2C localizes and binds to the mitochondria DNA, and directly modulates mitochondria-encoded gene expression. CRISPR/Cas-9-induced mutation of the MEF2C enhancer decreases expression of mitochondria-encoded genes. Moreover, MEF2C mutant cells show reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP level but elevation of oxidative stress. MEF2C deficiency in the upper and lower motor neurons of mice impairs mitochondria-encoded genes, and leads to mitochondrial metabolic disruption and progressive motor behavioral deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Together, MEF2C dysregulation by the enhancer mutation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which are prevalent features in motor neuronal damage and ALS pathogenesis. This genetic and epigenetic crosstalk mechanism provides insights for advancing our understanding of motor neuron disease and developing effective treatments. © 2024. The Author(s).",
  "39919076": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Osteoarthritis (OA) have been shown to have a close association in previous studies, but the pathogenesis of both diseases are unclear. This study explores the potential common molecular mechanisms between AD and OA through bioinformatics analysis, providing new insights for clinical treatment strategies. METHODS: The AD and OA-related datasets were downloaded from the gene expression database GEO. The datasets were analyzed to obtain differentially expressed gene (DEG) datasets for OA and AD, respectively. The intersection of these DEGs was analyzed to identify common DEGs (Co-DEGs). Subsequently, the Co-DEGs were enriched, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify core genes. The expression of these genes was validated in a separate dataset, and their diagnostic value for the diseases was analyzed. In addition, the core genes were analyzed using gene set enrichment analysis and single-gene genome variation analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of DEGs on gene chips from OA and AD patients revealed significant changes in gene expression patterns. Notably, EFEMP2 and TSPO, genes associated with inflammatory responses, showed lower expression levels in both AD and OA patients, suggesting a downregulation in the pathological backgrounds of these diseases. Additionally, GABARAPL1, which is crucial for the maturation of autophagosomes, was found to be upregulated in both conditions. These findings suggest the potential of these genes as diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. However, to confirm the effectiveness of these genes as therapeutic targets, more in-depth mechanistic studies are needed in the future, particularly to explore the feasibility and specific mechanisms of combating disease progression by regulating the expression of these genes. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that AD and OA shares common molecular mechanisms. The identification of EFEMP2, GABARAPL1, and TSPO as key target genes highlights potential common factors in both diseases. Further investigation into these findings could lead to new candidate targets and treatment directions for AD and OA, offering promising avenues for developing more effective and targeted therapeutic interventions.",
  "39910977": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in numerous disorders, including type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as pivotal regulators of cellular energy metabolism, yet their roles remain largely unclear. In this study, we identify an lncRNA named linc-PMB, which is associated with mTOR and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, through microarray analysis. We demonstrate that the knockdown of linc-PMB results in significantly impaired mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis, along with altered expressions of related genes. Conversely, overexpression of linc-PMB markedly increases mitochondrial function. We further reveal that linc-PMB interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuR, promoting the stabilization of SIRT1 mRNA and a substantial increase in SIRT1 expression, which in turn activates the PGC-1α/mtTFA pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel regulatory pathway in which linc-PMB, through its interaction with HuR, modulates the SIRT1/PGC-1α/mtTFA axis to maintain mitochondrial biogenesis and function.",

However, the molecular details of the contribution of ISL to AD remain largely elusive. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ISL against AD. In this study, AD targets and ISL targets were collected via different databases. The overlapped targets between AD and ISL were generated with Venny. Then we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses on these common targets. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and clusters were obtained using the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) and the Cytohubba plugins. Further, molecular docking study was performed for these core targets. Subsequently, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the assessment of hub gene expression levels between AD and healthy individuals were used to estimate a possible link between target genes in AD. Finally, experiments were conducted to verify the therapeutic mechanism of ISL in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 microglial cells. GO and KEGG pathway analysis found that ISL was significantly enriched in regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The PPI network manifested 7 key targets including albumin (ALB), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), solute carrier family 2 member 1 (SLC2A1), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ, PPARG). Molecular docking showed that ISL had high binding affinity with these key targets. The experimental results revealed that ISL decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and increased the expression of PPAR-γ, and suppressed the production of proinflammatory mediators.

  "39908957": "Two rimantadine derivatives, m-aminobenzoyl rimantadine (meta) and p-aminobenzoyl rimantadine (para), have been demonstrated to effectively inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. However, the exact atomic-level mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory mechanisms of meta and para on Aβ aggregation. Using replica-exchange and microsecond classical molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed the conformational ensembles of Aβ dimers and the structure of Aβ(1-40) protofibrils both with and without the rimantadine derivatives. Results showed that meta and para inhibit Aβ aggregation by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with Aβ dimers. Meta mainly binds to CHC residues F19 and F20 to disrupt hydrophobic contacts, while para targets β-turns and the K28-V40 region, destabilizing the hydrophobic core and increasing structural flexibility, thus preventing stable dimer formation. Para exhibits a higher binding affinity and is more effective in inhibiting Aβ aggregation and destabilizing protofibrils. These findings provide valuable insights into the atomic-level mechanisms by which meta and para inhibit Aβ aggregation, offering promising avenues for the exploration of potential therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

Our residue-specific NMR relaxation study revealed that the first prion domain of CPEB3 (PRD1) interacts with the 306VQIVYKPVDLSKV318 segment of tau and prevents the aggregation of tau-K18. Notably, this interaction is synergistic as it not only inhibits tau-K18 aggregation but also enhances PRD1 fibril formation. We also studied the interaction of different PRD1 subdomains with tau-K18 to elucidate the precise region of PRD1 that inhibits tau-K18 aggregation. This revealed that the PRD1-Q region is responsible for preventing tau-K18 aggregation.

SORL1 is an endosomal receptor that interacts with multiple protein sorting complexes to facilitate the transport of various cargoes through the endolysosomal network (ELN). However, the regulatory mechanisms governing SORL1 expression remain unknown. Through biochemical methods, we identified Forkhead Box P1 (FOXP1) as a binding protein to the minimal promoter region of SORL1 gene. Silencing FOXP1 using siRNA significantly decreased the activity of the SORL1 minimal promoter and reduced SORL1 protein and mRNA levels in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Additionally, using 5xFAD mouse models of AD, we observed significantly decreased FOXP1 and SORL1 expression in neurons within the prefrontal cortex. Disruption of ELN and the autophagy degradation system by bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) appeared to be a specific condition to suppress FOXP1 and hence SORL1 in SH-SY5Y cells.

  "39897171": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that continues to have a rising number of cases. While extensive research has been conducted in the last few decades, only a few drugs have been approved by the FDA for treatment, and even fewer aim to be curative rather than manage symptoms. There remains an urgent need for understanding disease pathogenesis, as well as identifying new targets for further drug discovery. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to stem from a build-up of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques as well as tangles of tau proteins. Furthermore, inflammation in the brain is known to arise from the degeneration of tissue and the build-up of insoluble material. Therefore, there is a potential link between the pathology of AD and inflammation in the brain, especially as the disease progresses to later stages where neuronal death and degeneration levels are higher. Proteins that are relevant to both brain inflammation and AD thus make ideal potential targets for therapeutics; however, the proteins need to be evaluated to determine which targets would be ideal for potential drug therapeutic treatments, or 'druggable'. Druggability analysis was conducted using two structure-based methods (i.e., Drug-Like Density analysis and SiteMap), as well as a sequence-based approach, SPIDER. The most druggable targets were then evaluated using single-nuclei sequencing data for their clinical relevance to inflammation in AD. For each of the top five targets, small molecule docking was used to evaluate which FDA approved drugs were able to bind with the chosen proteins. The top targets included DRD2 (inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity), C9 (binds with C5B8 to form the membrane attack complex), C4b (binds with C2a to form C3 convertase), C5AR1 (GPCR that binds C5a), and GABA-A-R (GPCR involved in inhibiting neurotransmission). Each target had multiple potential inhibitors from the FDA-approved drug list with decent binding infinities. Among these inhibitors, two drugs were found as top inhibitors for more than one protein target.

The details of AD pathogenesis have not been fully elucidated, and a comprehensive gene expression analysis of the process leading up to the onset of AD would be helpful for understanding the mechanism. We performed an RNA sequencing analysis on a cohort of 1227 Japanese blood samples, representing 424 AD patients, 543 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 260 cognitively normal (CN) individuals. A total of 883 and 1169 statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between CN and MCI (CN-MCI) and between MCI and AD (MCI-AD), respectively. Pathway analyses using these DEGs, followed by protein-protein interaction network analysis, revealed key roles of ribosomal function in MCI progression, whereas immune responses, cell cycle, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum were involved in AD progression. Our findings indicate that the onset of AD might be associated with gene expression changes in the immune system, cell cycle, and protein processing following alterations in the expression of ribosomal protein genes during the MCI stage, although validation using brain tissue samples will be necessary in the future.

  "39880167": "Phosphatidic acid (PA) through its unique negatively charged phosphate headgroup binds to various proteins to modulate multiple cellular events. To perform such diverse signaling functions, the ionization and charge of PA's headgroup rely on the properties of vicinal membrane lipids and changes in cellular conditions. Cholesterol has conspicuous effects on lipid properties and membrane dynamics. In eukaryotic cells, its concentration increases along the secretory pathway, reaching its highest levels toward the plasma membrane. Moreover, membrane cholesterol levels are altered in certain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and in erythrocytes of hypercholesteremia patients. Hence, those changing levels of cholesterol could affect PA's charge and alter binding to effector protein. However, no study has investigated the direct impact of cholesterol on the ionization properties of PA. Here, we used 31P MAS NMR to explore the effects of increasing cholesterol concentrations on the chemical shifts and pKa2 of PA. We find that, while the chemical shifts of PA change significantly at high cholesterol concentrations, surprisingly, the pKa2 and charge of PA under these conditions are not modified. Furthermore, using in vitro lipid binding assays we found that higher cholesterol levels increased PA binding of the Spo20p PA sensor. Finally, in cellulo experiments demonstrated that depleting cholesterol from neurosecretory cells halts the recruitment of this sensor upon PA addition. Altogether, these data suggest that the intracellular cholesterol gradient may be an important regulator of proteins binding to PA and that disruption of those levels in certain pathologies may also affect PA binding to its target proteins and subsequent signaling pathways.",

We designed native peptides derived from the PYDs of NLRP3 and ASC based on their interfacial interaction to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome formation. Screening revealed that NP3, derived from NLRP3, inhibits inflammasome activation. Furthermore, a strategic mutation (F → L) in native peptide NP3 results in MNP2 that selectively binds to PYD of ASC with nanomolar affinity, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome formation, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release, and caspase-1 maturation. MNP2 also reduced potassium (K) and chloride (Cl) ion efflux, key signals in NLRP3 activation, and prevented mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. MNP2 significantly reduced NLRP3 inflammasome formation in neurodegenerative conditions triggered by amyloid-β (Aβ), Tau, and α-Synuclein (α-Syn), suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for NLRP3-related inflammatory diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders.",

PURPOSE: We here aim to identify the shared molecular signatures between nHIBD and AD. We used an integrated analysis of the cortex gene expression data, targeting differential expression of genes related to the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment following traumatic brain injury. METHODS: The gene expression profiles of Alzheimer's disease (GSE203206) and that of Neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage (GSE23317) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of Alzheimer's disease and neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage by limma package analysis, five kinds of analyses were performed on them, namely Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network, DEG-transcription factor interactions and DEG-microRNA interactions, protein-drug interactions and protein-disease association analysis, and gene-inflammation association analysis and protein-inflammation association analysis. RESULTS: In total, 12 common DEGs were identified including HSPB1, VIM, MVD, TUBB4A, AACS, ANXA6, DIRAS2, RPH3A, CEND1, KALM, THOP1, AREL1. We also identified 11 hub proteins, three central regulatory transcription factors, and three microRNAs encoded by the DEGs.

Gene-disease association analysis shows Mammary Neoplasms, Neoplasm Metastasis, Schizophrenia, and Brain Ischemia diseases are the most relevant to the hub proteins we identified. Gene-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub gene AREL1 is related to inflammatory response, while the protein-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub proteins AKT1 and MAPK14 are related to inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the shared molecular mechanisms between AD and nHIBD. These common pathways and hub genes could potentially be used to design therapeutic interventions, reducing the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease development in survivors of neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemia brain injury.",
  "39870805": "Aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the prevalence of AD increased, a mechanistic linkage between aging and the pathogenesis of AD needs to be further addressed. Here, we report that a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) modification of p53 is implicated in the process which remarkably increased in AD patient's brain. Mechanistically, SUMOylation of p53 at K386 residue causes the dissociation of SET/p53 complex, thus releasing SET into the cytoplasm, SET further interacts with cytoplasmic PP2A and inhibits its activity, resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons. In addition, SUMOylation of p53 promotes the p53 Ser15 phosphorylation that mediates neuronal senescence. Notably, p53 SUMOylation contributes to synaptic damage and cognitive defects in AD model mice. We also demonstrate that the SUMOylation inhibiter, Ginkgolic acid, recovering several senescent phenotypes drove by p53 SUMOylation in primary neurons. These findings suggest a previously undiscovered etiopathogenic relationship between aging and AD that is linked to p53 SUMOylation and the potential of SUMOylated p53-based therapeutics for neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease. © 2025.

  "39859237": "The immune system and neuroinflammation are now well established in the aetiology of neurodegeneration. Previous studies of transcriptomic and gene association studies have highlighted the potential of the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) to play a role in Alzheimer's disease. OAS1 is a viral response gene, interferon-induced, dsRNA activated enzyme, which binds RNase L to degrade dsRNA, and has been associated with COVID-19 response. This study explores whether a viral defence gene could play a vital role in neurodegeneration pathology. The genotyping of five SNPs across the OAS1 locus was conducted in the Brains for Dementia Research (BDR) Cohort for association with AD. RNA-sequencing data were explored for differences in OAS1 gene expression between phenotypes and genotypes. Finally, levels of dsRNA were measured in control cell lines, prior to and after exposure to amyloid oligomers and in cells harbouring a dementia-relevant mutation. No association of any of the OAS1 SNPs investigated were associated with the AD phenotype in the BDR cohort. However, gene expression data supported the previous observation that the minor allele haplotype was associated with higher levels of the OAS1 gene expression and the presence of an alternative transcript. Further to this, the presence of endogenous dsRNA was found to increase with exposure to amyloid oligomers and in the cell line with a dementia-relevant mutation. The data presented here suggest further exploration of the OAS1 gene in relation to dementia is warranted. Investigations of whether carriers of the protective OAS1 haplotype lower dsRNA presence and in turn lower inflammation and cell death are required to support the role of the gene as a moderator of neurodegeneration.",
  "39857391": "Geniposidic 4-isoamyl ester (GENI) with anti-aging effects is a new iridoid glycoside derivative from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis found in our previous study. In this study, to indicate whether this compound has anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) effect, the galactose-induced AD mice and naturally aging mice with AD were used to do drug efficacy evaluation. Furthermore, the Western blot, small interfering RNA (siRNA), drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), cellular thermal shift assay (CESTA), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS), adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mutants and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis were utilized to clarify the mechanism of action and identify target protein of this molecule. GENI exerts anti-AD efficacy in galactose-induced AD mice and naturally aging mice with AD through neuroprotection and modification of autophagy and neuron inflammation. Moreover, AMPK as the target protein of GENI to produce an anti-AD effect is identified and the ASP148, ASP157, and ASP166 of the AMPK α subunit and lysine (LYS)148, aspartic acid (ASP)156, LYS309, and ASP316 in the AMPK γ subunit as binding sites are confirmed.

  "39857387": "Investigating amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in solution is essential during the initial stages of developing lead compounds that can influence Aβ fibrillation while the peptide is still in a soluble state. The tendency of the Aβ(1-42) peptide to misfold in solution, correlated to the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is one of the main hindrances to characterising its aggregation kinetics in a cell-mimetic environment. Moreover, the Aβ(1-42) aggregation triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to cellular dysfunction and multiple cell death modalities, exacerbated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cellular components and trigger inflammation. Antioxidants like curcumin, a derivative of Curcuma longa, help mitigate ER stress by scavenging ROS and enhancing antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, evidence in the literature highlights the effect of curcumin on the secondary structure of Aβ(1-42). This explorative study investigates the Aβ(1-42) peptide conformational behaviour in the presence of curcumin and six derivatives using circular dichroism (CD) to explore their interactions with lipid bilayers, potentially preventing aggregate formation. The results suggest that the synthetic tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) derivative interacts with the amyloid peptide in all the systems presented, while cyclocurcumin (CYC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BMDC) only interact when the peptide is in a less stable conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations helped visualise the curcuminoids' effect in an aqueous system and hypothesise the importance of the peptide surface exposition to the solvent, differently modulated by the curcumin derivatives.",

While molecular changes in central nervous system (CNS) cells contribute to this decline, the mechanisms are not fully understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of cellular functions. Background/Objectives: The roles of lncRNAs in aging, especially in glial cells, are not well characterized. Methods: We investigated lncRNA expression in non-neuronal cells from aged mice and identified 3222401L13Rik, a previously unstudied lncRNA, as upregulated in astrocytes during aging. Results: Knockdown of 3222401L13Rik in primary astrocytes revealed its critical role in regulating genes for neuronal support and synapse organization, a function conserved in human iPSC-derived astrocytes. A 3222401L13Rik interacts with the transcription factor Neuronal PAS Domain Protein 3 (Npas3), and overexpression of Npas3 rescues deficits in astrocytes lacking 3222401L13Rik.

Deletion of the C17 alkyl group from the cholestane skeleton improves water solubility, however these compounds inhibit both SHIP1 and SHIP2. Enzyme kinetics imply that these molecules are competitive inhibitors of SHIP, binding at a site near where the substrate binds to the phosphatase. A model of the binding of the inhibitors within the active site of SHIP1 is proposed to explain the structure activity studies.

  "39843141": "The nuclear pore complex, a large multimeric structure consists of numerous protein components, serves as a crucial gatekeeper for the transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. Dysfunction of the NPC has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In AD, Tau aggregates interact with NPC proteins, known as nucleoporins, leading to disruptions in nuclear transport. Hyperphosphorylated Tau, a hallmark of AD pathology, interacts with central channel NUPs such as Nup62 and Nup98, causing cytoplasmic mis-localization of these proteins and impairing nuclear transport. Furthermore, Tau-NUP interactions promote Tau aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, exacerbating neurodegeneration. Oligomeric Tau adheres to the lamin B receptor as well as nuclear lamin, preventing nucleocytoplasmic transport and resulting in heterochromatin unwinding, DNA damage, and neuronal death. The decrease in lamin B and increasing levels of lamin A along with C in AD-affected brain areas highlight the disease's intricacy. Furthermore, Tau internalization in the nucleus and interaction with nuclear pore complexes worsen NPC dysfunction, which contributes to neurotoxicity. Tau-DNA interactions suggest a chaperone-like role for Tau in DNA organization and repair, highlighting its involvement in maintaining genomic integrity. This review explores the intricate relationships between Tau, NPC components, and nuclear lamin in the context of AD, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying Tau-induced neurodegeneration and potential therapeutic targets.",
  "39830273": "BACKGROUND: Analyzing disease-linked genetic variants via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is important for identifying potential disease-causing genes. Previous research prioritized genes by integrating Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results with tissue-level eQTLs. Recent studies have explored brain cell type-specific eQTLs, but they lack a systematic analysis across various Alzheimer's disease (AD) GWAS datasets, nor did they compare effects between tissue and cell type levels or across different cell type-specific eQTL datasets. In this study, we integrated brain cell type-specific eQTL datasets with AD GWAS datasets to identify potential causal genes at the cell type level. METHODS: To prioritize disease-causing genes, we used Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Bayesian Colocalization (COLOC) to integrate AD GWAS summary statistics with cell-type-specific eQTLs. Combining data from five AD GWAS, three single-cell eQTL datasets, and one bulk tissue eQTL meta-analysis, we identified and confirmed both novel and known candidate causal genes. We investigated gene regulation through enhancer activity using H3K27ac and ATAC-seq data, performed protein-protein interaction and pathway enrichment analyses, and conducted a drug/compound enrichment analysis with the Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB) to support drug repurposing for AD. RESULTS: We identified 27 candidate causal genes for AD using cell type-specific eQTL datasets, with the highest numbers in microglia, followed by excitatory neurons, astrocytes, inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). PABPC1 emerged as a novel astrocyte-specific gene. Our analysis revealed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for these causal genes in microglia and astrocytes. We found the \"regulation of aspartic-type peptidase activity\" pathway being the most enriched among all the causal genes. AD-risk variants associated with candidate causal gene PABPC1 is located near or within enhancers only active in astrocytes. We classified the genes into three drug tiers and identified druggable interactions, with imatinib mesylate emerging as a key candidate. A drug-target gene network was created to explore potential drug targets for AD. CONCLUSIONS: We systematically prioritized AD candidate causal genes based on cell type-specific molecular evidence. The integrative approach enhances our understanding of molecular mechanisms of AD-related genetic variants and facilitates the interpretation of AD GWAS results.",

Combined with activity assays, we assigned the residues that specifically bind two molecules of phosphatidylserine (PS) that are arranged in a \"tail-to-tail\" manner. Pull-down assays confirmed that ApoE directly interacts with ABCA7; and moreover, both ATPase and lipid transport activities of ABCA7 were significantly enhanced in the presence of ApoE. We also measured the activities of a familial AD variant and a protective clinically reported variant in the ABCA7 gene.

The Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine 2.0 (ETCM2.0) database was used to collect the active components of CYW, and the putative targets were predicted in ETCM2.0 and SwissTargetPrediction database. The AD related targets were collected from GeneCards, comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), DisGeNET and Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), the ferroptosis related targets were collected from FerrDb V2 database, and the common targets of CYW, AD and ferroptosis were calculated by Venny2.1 platform. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed by STRING database, and the active compounds-target network and the PPI network were constructed using Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome pathway enrichment analysis were performed through DAVID database. RSL3 was used to induce HT22 cells to establish a neuronal ferroptosis cell model, and the inhibitory effect of CYW on neuronal ferroptosis was evaluated by cell viability assay, intracellular iron assay and lipid peroxidation staining. The ferroptosis-associated key protein expressions of Nrf2, SLC7A11, GPX4 and FTH1 were detected by Western blot. A total of 100 candidate compounds were identified from CYW, and 1129 putative targets were obtained. 3924 AD-related targets and 564 ferroptosis-related targets were collected, respectively. There were 78 common targets between them and CYW targets, which were potential targets for CYW to regulate ferroptosis in the treatment of AD. PPI network analysis identified 10 key targets, including TP53, IL6, STAT3, HIF1A, NFE2L2, and others. GO, KEGG and Reactome enrichment analysis showed that 78 potential targets were involved in the regulation of ferroptosis and Nrf2-mediated gene transcription. Molecular docking showed that some active components of CYW had good affinity with Nrf2. In RSL3-induced HT22 cells, CYW significantly improved cell viability, reduced intracellular iron levels and inhibited lipid peroxidation, and improved the protein expression of Nrf2, SLC7A11, GPX4 and FTH1.

Further, ApoE3 R136S demonstrates more robust effects in attenuating AEP activation and Tau PFF spreading in the brains of both 5xFAD and Tau P301S mice than in ApoE3 WT, leading to improved cognitive functions. Thus, our findings support the idea that ApoE3 R136S strongly binds Tau and decreases its cellular uptake, abrogating Tau pathology propagation in AD brains.",

Integrating NMR spectroscopy, SAXS, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis we reveal the structural basis of the p23-FKBP51 complex. We show that p23 specifically recognizes the TPR domain of FKBP51 and interacts with tau through its C-terminal disordered tail. We further show that the p23-FKBP51 complex binds tau to form a dynamic p23-FKBP51-tau trimeric complex that delays tau aggregation and thus may counteract Hsp90-FKBP51 mediated toxicity.

Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the fluspirilene-PDE5 complex is stable and maintains its structural integrity over time. Binding energy calculations further highlighted favorable interactions, indicating that the drug forms a strong and stable bond with PDE5. Additional analyses, including studies of protein dynamics and energy landscape mapping, revealed how the drug interacts dynamically with PDE5, adapting to different conformations and maintaining stability.

It has been widely studied for its therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly through the amyloidosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation pathways. Nevertheless, the mechanisms through which it exerts its neuroprotective effects in AD are still largely unknown. Data mining was used to identify potential gene targets that link melatonin's effects to AD pathways, yielding a comprehensive view of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We identified 3397 genes related to AD from DisGeNet and 329 melatonin gene targets from ChEMBL, which revealed 223 overlapping genes and the potential shared pathways. These genes were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network comprising 143 nodes and 823 edges, which demonstrated significant PPI enrichment. A cluster analysis highlighted two key clusters centered on MMP2 and NR3C1, with both genes playing crucial roles in steroid hormone signaling, apoptosis, and monoamine neurotransmission. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses further elucidated their involvement in critical pathways, for instance, steroid hormone signaling and apoptosis regulation, significantly influencing AD pathology through mechanisms such as extracellular matrix remodeling, epigenetic modifications, and neuroinflammation.

  "39779912": "The abnormal deposition of amyloid β (Aβ), produced by proteolytic cleavage events of amyloid precursor protein involving the protease γ-secretase and subsequent polymerization into amyloid plaques, plays a key role in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that ErbB3 binding protein 1 (EBP1)/proliferation-associated 2G4 (PA2G4) interacts with presenilin, a catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, inhibiting Aβ production. Mice lacking forebrain Ebp1/Pa2g4 recapitulate the representative phenotypes of late-onset sporadic AD, displaying an age-dependent increase in Aβ deposition, amyloid plaques and cognitive dysfunction. In postmortem brains of patients with AD and 5x-FAD mice, we found that EBP1 is proteolytically cleaved by asparagine endopeptidase at N84 and N204 residues, compromising its inhibitory effect on γ-secretase, increasing Aβ aggregation and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, injection of AAV2-Ebp1 wild-type or an asparagine endopeptidase-uncleavable mutant into the brains of 5x-FAD mice decreased Aβ generation and alleviated the behavioral impairments. Thus, our study suggests that EBP1 acts as an inhibitor of γ-secretase on amyloid precursor protein cleavage and preservation of functional EBP1 could be a therapeutic strategy for AD. © 2025.

We introduce \"genome-wide association neural networks (GWANN)\" a novel approach that uses neural networks (NNs) to perform a gene-level association study with family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In UK Biobank, we defined cases (n = 42 110) as those with AD or family history of AD and sampled an equal number of controls. The data was split into an 80:20 ratio of training and testing samples, and GWANN was trained on the former followed by identifying associated genes using its performance on the latter. Our method identified 18 genes to be associated with family history of AD. APOE, BIN1, SORL1, ADAM10, APH1B, and SPI1 have been identified by previous AD GWAS. Among the 12 new genes, PCDH9, NRG3, ROR1, LINGO2, SMYD3, and LRRC7 have been associated with neurofibrillary tangles or phosphorylated tau in previous studies. Furthermore, there is evidence for differential transcriptomic or proteomic expression between AD and healthy brains for 10 of the 12 new genes.

  "39775030": "Numerous studies of the human brain supported by experimental results from rodent and cell models point to a central role for intracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) in the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a rat model used to study AD, it was recently shown that in layer II neurons of the anteriolateral entorhinal cortex expressing high levels of the glycoprotein reelin (Re+alECLII neurons), reelin and Aβ engage in a direct protein-protein interaction. If reelin functions as a sink for intracellular Aβ and if the binding to reelin makes Aβ physiologically inert, it implies that reelin can prevent the neuron from being exposed to the harmful effects typically associated with increased levels of oligomeric Aβ. Considering that reelin expression is extraordinarily high in Re+alECLII neurons compared to most other cortical neurons, such a protective role appears to be very difficult to reconcile with the fact that this subset of ECLII neurons is clearly a major cradle for the onset of AD. Here, we show that this conundrum can be resolved if Re+alECLII neurons have a higher maximum production capacity of Aβ than neurons expressing low levels of reelin, and we provide a rationale for why this difference has evolved.",

Third, TGM2 binds to calmodulin, a regulatory event that can increase the activity of this enzyme threefold. Fourth, the most common mixed pathology toxic biomarkers (Aβ, pTau, αSyn, nHtt) also bind calmodulin, which can affect their ability to aggregate.

In order to achieve a diagnostic accuracy as high as possible, the diagnosis of AD during life depends on various biomarkers, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Methods: Classical CSF AD biomarkers were determined in a total of 61 patients, classified as both beta amyloid- and tau-positive A+T+ (or A+T1+ according to the recently revised Alzheimer Association criteria for diagnosis and staging of AD). Twenty one of these patients fulfilled the criteria for mixed AD (mixed with Lewy bodies, cerebrovascular disease, or normal pressure hydrocephalus), whilst 40 had pure AD. Results: Patients did not differ with respect to gender, education, disease duration, and cognitive status. After controlling for confounding factors, no difference was observed between mixed and pure AD groups in Aβ42 or Aβ42/Aβ40 levels. Although by definition, patients of both groups had abnormal (increased) levels of phospho-tau181, the mixed AD group presented with lower (less abnormal) levels of phospho-tau181 and total tau as compared to the pure group. Conclusions: In patients with AD of comparable cognitive status, mixed AD cases may present with lower levels of tau proteins and, if close to the cut-off values, diagnostic uncertainty may be increased.",

Previous studies have shown neuronal death in the brains of AD patients, but the role of cuproptosis and its associated genes in AD neurons remains unclear. METHODS: Intersection analysis was conducted using the AD transcriptome dataset GSE63060, neuron dataset GSE147528, and reported cuproptosis-related genes to identify the cuproptosis key gene FDX1 highly expressed in AD. Subsequently, cell experiments were performed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ25-35 to establish AD cell model. The real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting (WB) assays were employed to detect the expression levels of FDX1, DLAT, and DLST. Cell proliferation was analyzed by counting Kit-8 (CCK8), mitochondrial ROS levels were analyzed using flow cytometry. shRNA was used to downregulate FDX1 expression, followed by repetition of the aforementioned experiments. Clinical experiments utilized qPCR to detect FDX1 mRNA levels in peripheral venous blood of patients, and analyzed FDX1 expression differences in different APOE genotypes of AD patients. Finally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of FDX1 was constructed based on the GeneMANIA database, immune infiltration analysis was conducted using R language, and transcription factors prediction for FDX1 was performed based on the ENCODE database. RESULTS: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 showed significantly higher expression in peripheral blood and neuron models of AD compared to non-AD individuals, with significantly higher expression in APOE ε4/ε4 genotype than other APOE genotype of AD patients. Knockdown of FDX1 expression reduced the lipidation levels of DLAT and DLST in neurons, alleviated ROS accumulation in mitochondria, improved cell viability, and mitigated cuproptosis. Immune infiltration analysis results indicated a high enrichment of peripheral blood γδ-T lymphocytes in AD, and FDX1 was significantly associated with the infiltration of four immune cells and may be regulated by three transcription factors. CONCLUSION: The cuproptosis key gene FDX1 is highly expressed in AD and may promote cuproptosis in AD neurons by regulating the lipidation levels of DLAT and DLST, thereby participating in the onset and development of AD. This provides a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",

The interaction of Aβ with the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) facilitates cerebral uptake of Aβ and exacerbates its neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, further augmenting BACE1 expression. Given the limitations of previous BACE1 inhibition efforts, the study explores reducing BACE1 expression to mitigate AD pathology. The research reveals that the anticancer agent 6-thioguanosine (6-TG) markedly diminishes BACE1 expression without eliciting cytotoxicity while enhancing microglial phagocytic activity, and ameliorate cognitive impairments with reducing Aβ accumulation in AD mice. Leveraging advanced deep learning-based tool for target identification, and corroborating with surface plasmon resonance assays, it is elucidated that 6-TG directly interacts with RAGE, modulating BACE1 expression through the JAK2-STAT1 pathway and elevating soluble RAGE (sRAGE) levels in the brain. The findings illuminate the therapeutic potential of 6-TG in ameliorating AD manifestations and advocate for small molecule strategies to increase brain sRAGE levels, offering a strategic alternative to the challenges posed by the complexity of AD. © 2025 The Author(s).

Given FLT1's role in angiogenesis and immune activation, we hypothesized that FLT1 is upregulated in response to amyloid pathology, driving a vascular-immune cascade resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We sought to determine (1) if in vivo FLT1 levels (CSF and plasma) associate with biomarkers of AD neuropathology or differ between diagnostic staging in an aged cohort enriched for early disease, and (2) whether FLT1 expression interacts with amyloid on downstream outcomes, such as phosphorylated tau levels and cognitive performance. Additionally, we sought to replicate FLT1 interactions in the brain. The results showed that higher levels of FLT1 in CSF and post-mortem brain tissue related to increased tau, particularly among amyloid positive individuals.

The purpose of this work was to reveal key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hippocampus of AD patients and healthy individuals. Furthermore, we established an in vivo AD-like model to validate and explore the effects of exercise on these risky genes. The datasets GSE36980 and GSE48350 were downloaded from the GEO database and visualized using R packages to obtain DEGs. Subsequently, the potential biological functions of these DEGs were predicted, PPI network interactions were screened for core genes, and Pearson correlation analysis was performed. Additionally, we determined the diagnostic value of core DEGs using ROC curves. Single-cell analysis was used to verify the cell type specificity of hub genes. Finally, we used RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence to validate the expression of core DEGs in model mice and to explore the beneficial mechanisms of exercise. A total of 13 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the development of AD were identified, comprising 11 down-regulated genes and 2 up-regulated genes. PPI network visualization acquired four down-regulated core DEGs with good diagnostic value. The findings from the in vivo study indicated that the mRNA expression of GABRA1, GABRG2, and SVOP decreased, and the astrocyte marker GFAP notably increased in AD mice. Surprisingly, exercise increased hippocampal GABRA1 and GABRG2 expression and decreased GFAP-positive intensity of GABRG1 localization, reducing expression of inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-1β. In addition, exercise improved the spatial exploration ability but had little effect on the preference index in AD mice. Our data highlighted the mechanism by which exercise improves memory performance in AD patients by reducing astrocyte neurotoxicity inducing decreased hippocampal GABA receptor expression. © 2024.

  "39730451": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by limited effective treatments, underscoring the critical need for early detection and diagnosis to improve intervention outcomes. This study integrates various bioinformatics methodologies with interpretable machine learning to identify reliable biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and construction of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Networks, we meticulously analyzed the AD dataset from the GEO database to pinpoint Hub genes. Subsequently, various machine learning algorithms were employed to construct diagnostic models, which were then elucidated using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To visualize our findings, we generated an insightful bioinformatics map of 10 Hub genes. We then conducted experimental validation on less-studied Hub genes, revealing significant differential mRNA expression of MYH9 and RHOQ in an AD cell model. Finally, we explored the biological significance of these two genes at the single-cell transcriptome level. This study not only introduces interactive SHAP panels for precise decision-making in AD but also offers novel insights into the identification of AD biomarkers through interpretable machine learning diagnostic models. Particularly, MYH9 has emerged as a promising new potential biomarker, pointing the way towards enhanced diagnostic accuracy and personalized therapeutic strategies for AD. Although the mRNA expression patterns of RHOQ are opposite in AD cell models and human brain tissue samples, the role of RHOQ in AD remains worthy of further exploration due to the diversity and complexity of biological molecular regulation. © 2024.

  "39710406": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairments. Despite extensive research, its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood, and effective treatments are limited. This study explored the therapeutic potential of agarwood in AD by integrating network pharmacology, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and single-cell expression analysis. The results revealed that agarwood compounds may modulate key inflammatory genes such as NFKB1, STAT1, and TLR4, alleviating neuroinflammation; enhance the expression of HSP90 and regulate KDR signaling to improve blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity; and promote the activity of PTPN11 and CXCR4 to support oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) repair and remyelination. Single-cell expression analysis highlighted cell-type-specific expression patterns, particularly in OPCs and endothelial cells, underscoring their relevance in AD pathology. Agarwood's multi-dimensional therapeutic potential positions it as a promising candidate for the development of novel AD treatments.",
  "39695808": "BACKGROUND: The CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) was initially identified in peripheral immune cells and regulates cytoskeleton and protein trafficking. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD2AP gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functional role of CD2AP, especially its role in microglia during AD onset, remains elusive. METHODS: CD2AP protein levels in cultured primary cells and in 5xFAD mice was studied. Microglial CD2AP-deficient mice were crossed with 5xFAD mice and the offspring were subjected to neuropathological assessment, behavioral tests, electrophysiology, RNA-seq, Golgi staining, and biochemistry analysis. Primary microglia were also isolated for assessing their uptake and morphology changes. RESULTS: We find that CD2AP is abundantly expressed in microglia and its levels are elevated in the brain of AD patients and the 5xFAD model mice at pathological stages. We demonstrate that CD2AP haploinsufficiency in microglia significantly attenuates cognitive and synaptic deficits, weakens the response of microglia to Aβ and the formation of disease-associated microglia (DAM), and alleviates synapse loss in 5xFAD mice. We show that CD2AP-deficient microglia exhibit compromised uptake ability. In addition, we find that CD2AP expression is positively correlated with the expression of the complement C1q that is important for synapse phagocytosis and the formation of DAM in response to Aβ deposition. Moreover, we reveal that CD2AP interacts with colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and regulates CSF1R cell surface levels, which may further affect C1q expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that CD2AP regulates microgliosis and identify a protective function of microglial CD2AP deficiency against Aβ deposition, suggesting the importance of detailed investigation of AD-associated genes in different brain cells for thoroughly understanding their exact contribution to AD. © 2024.

  "39694170": "BACKGROUND: Smoking is detrimental to health, with tobacco use being a critical factor in the development of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which progressively impairs brain function and poses a significant threat to public health. This study aims to examine the potential genetic alterations induced by smoking that are associated with AD and to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanisms. The research will provide theoretical foundations for targeted prevention and treatment strategies for AD. METHODS: This study analyzed datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) to identify genes affected by tobacco smoke exposure and those altered in patients with AD relative to normal controls. We conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses using OmicShare tools to screen for key pathways. Key genes were identified by constructing protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) in the STRING database with the aid of CytoHubba. Additionally, the binding activity of the proteins encoded by these key genes to nicotine, the main component of tobacco, was analyzed using molecular docking techniques. Finally, the analytical results were verified using Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. RESULTS: The CTD identified 12,164 CE-related genes affected by tobacco smoke exposure. A comparison of these datasets yielded 94 common genes that were both influenced by tobacco and differentially expressed across all brain regions. The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that these common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly enriched in the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. The DEGs' PPI network, constructed using the STRING database, highlighted key genes such as HSP90AB1, SOS2, MAGI1, and YWHAZ. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that nicotine binds effectively to the protein structures of these key genes, primarily through amino acid residues such as Ser and Glu. Experimental validation showed that HSP90AB1 and YWHAZ exhibited notable expression discrepancies under varying concentrations of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments, particularly demonstrating a pronounced down-regulation trend at elevated concentrations. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that tobacco may impact the function of transmembrane transporter proteins and contribute to the development of AD by affecting key genes such as HSP90AB1 and YWHAZ, as well as signaling pathways like PI3K-AKT.",

  "39680531": "HuD plays a critical role in neurite outgrowth, neuronal plasticity, and survival. However, HuD autoantibodies from patients with paraneoplastic gut dysmotility can trigger the apoptotic cascade in human neuroblastoma cell line and myenteric neurons. The mechanism by which HuD regulates the apoptotic pathway is unclear. Apoptosis is one of the underlying causes of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, we found that HuD interacts with Msi2 transcript and positively regulates it in the mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells. MSI2 being an RNA binding protein has diverse mRNA targets and regulates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by interacting with and repressing APAF1 transcript. Conversely, the reduced levels of HuD leads to decreased Msi2 expression and increased APAF1 levels, which results in apoptosis in N2a cells. Overall, our research indicates that HuD and Msi2 possess an anti-apoptotic role in N2A cells.",
  "39677701": "Pathological tau spreads throughout the brain along neuronal connections in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms that underlie this process are poorly understood. Given the high incidence and deleterious consequences of epileptiform activity in AD, we hypothesized neuronal hyperactivity and seizures are key factors in tau spread. To examine these interactions, we created a novel mouse model involving the cross of targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP) mice and the 5 times familial AD (5XFAD; 5X-TRAP) model allowing for the permanent fluorescent labelling of neuronal activity. To establish a causal role of seizures in tau spread, we seeded mice with human AD brain-derived tau lysate and induced seizures with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. Comprehensive brain mapping of tau pathology and neuronal activity revealed that basal hyperactivity in 5X-TRAP mice was associated with increased tau spread, which was exacerbated by seizure induction through activated networks and correlated with memory deficits. Computational modeling revealed that anterograde tau spread was elevated in 5X-TRAP mice and that regional neuronal activity was predictive of tau spread to that brain region. On a cellular level, we found that in both saline and PTZ-treated 5X-TRAP mice, hyperactive neurons disproportionately contributed to the spread of tau. Further, we found that Synaptogyrin-3, a synaptic vesicle protein that interacts with tau, was increased following PTZ kindling in 5X-TRAP mice, possibly indicative of a synaptic mechanism underlying seizure-exacerbated tau spread. Importantly, postmortem AD brain tissue from patients with a history of seizures showed increased tau pathology in patterns indicative of increased spread and increased Synaptogyrin-3 levels compared to those without seizures. Overall, our study identifies neuronal hyperactivity and seizures as key factors underlying the pathobiological and cognitive progression of AD. Therapies targeting these factors should be tested clinically to slow tau spread and AD progression.",

This study aimed to construct a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network through bioinformatics methods to explore energy metabolism-related genes in the pathogenesis of TBI. METHODS: Data from datasets GSE171718, GSE131695, and GSE223245 obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus, were analyzed to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes. Regulatory relationships were investigated through miRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan, thereby forming a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) was utilized to identify energy metabolism-related genes, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established through the STRING database. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis were conducted using GO and KEGG. The TBI mouse model was established to detect the expression levels of GOLGA8B, ZNF367, and SMPD3 in brain tissues. RESULTS: SMPD3 emerged as the key DE gene linked to energy metabolism in TBI, demonstrating a negative correlation with miR-218-5p and being associated with moderate unconsciousness and female patients. The PPI network revealed SMPD3 interactions with proteins associated with cell death, sphingolipid metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In vivo, GOLGA8B, ZNF367, and SMPD3 mRNA levels were significantly lower in TBI mice. CONCLUSION: In summary, SMPD3 represents a crucial metabolic gene in the progression of TBI.

These isoforms differ slightly in amino acid sequence and have similar structures, but differ in localization and functioning. During functioning, actin interacts with a large number of proteins, which are combined according to this feature into a pool of so-called actin-binding proteins. The question arises whether and how the proteins interacting with different actin isoforms differ. Since the pool of actin-binding proteins includes hundreds of proteins, it was logical to use bioinformatics analysis to solve the questions.

  "39670805": "Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is a highly reactive nitrogen species that can cause significant damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA. Various enzymes, including metalloenzymes, play crucial roles in reducing ONOO- concentrations to protect cellular components. While the interaction of ONOO- with heme proteins is well known, the reduction by Cu-containing proteins is less studied. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), implicated in Alzheimer's disease, has an E2 domain that binds copper ions with a dissociation constant of KD ∼ 10-12 M and is proposed to be involved in iron homeostasis, copper trafficking, and oxidative stress response. Our recent studies using EXAFS, UV-Vis, and EPR spectroscopy revealed a previously unidentified labile water ligand in the Cu(II) site of the E2 domain, suggesting reactivity with anionic substrates like ONOO-. Experimental data showed that Cu(I)-E2 reduces ONOO- at a significant rate (1.1 × 105 M-1 s-1), comparable to native peroxynitrite scavengers, while maintaining active site integrity through multiple redox cycles. This study further investigates the mechanism of ONOO- reduction by Cu(I)-E2 using the Griess assay, demonstrating that reduction occurs via single electron transfer, forming nitrite and nitrate. This process aligns with previous findings that Cu(I)-E2 is oxidized to Cu(II)-E2 upon ONOO- reduction. Mutations at Lys435, affecting secondary sphere interactions, revealed that factors beyond electrostatics are involved in substrate recruitment. MD simulations suggest that steric hindrance from a newly formed hydrogen bond also plays a role. Understanding ONOO- reduction by the E2 domain of APP expands our knowledge of copper proteins in mitigating oxidative stress and elucidates their physiological and pathological roles, particularly in Alzheimer's disease.",

There remains a paucity of effective diagnostic biomarkers for this condition. This study aims to develop and validate a novel LLPS-related molecular signature to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and early detection of AD. METHODS: LLPS-related genes were identified from online databases and subjected to bioinformatic analyses, including protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Based on the optimal LLPS-related genes, a diagnosis risk model was constructed, and the diagnostic ability was evaluated using a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. To elucidate the biological functions of the identified LLPS-related genes, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 149 LLPS-related genes were screened, which were found to be involved in functions related to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cancer progression. The 149 genes were refined to six optimal candidates through PPI network analysis and LASSO regression: Activator of HSP90 ATPase Activity 1 (AHSA1), Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2 Alpha Kinase 2 (EIF2AK2), Heat Shock Protein Family A (Hsp70) Member 4 (HSPA4), Notch Receptor 1 (NOTCH1), Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1), and Thioredoxin (TXN). Based on the six optimal genes, a diagnostic risk model was constructed, and the diagnostic ability was verified to be promising in AD both in training, internal validation, and two external validation datasets, with area under ROC curve (AUC) above 0.8. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between the expression of these genes and tumor immune cell infiltration.

  "39655660": "To date, several studies have integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from bulk tissues to identify novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic variants and susceptibility genes. However, there is highly cell-type-specific nature in different bulk eQTL data. Until now, eQTL data from different brain single cells have been reported. Therefore, integrating eQTL data from different brain single-cell types along with AD GWAS data makes biological sense for studying the potential biological explanations of AD. Here, we utilized the summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to integrate AD GWAS data with eQTL data from eight brain single-cell types. We identified a larger number of significant genes compared to previous SMR study based on bulk eQTL. Notably, microglia exhibited the highest number of significant genes. Moreover, we conducted validation-phase SMR analysis, single-cell analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), druggability evaluation, functional enrichment analyses, and colocalization analysis of the top 20 SMR significant genes in microglia. We found that most genes passed the validation and were significantly enriched in microglia. PPI analysis uncovered interactions among PICALM, BIN1, RIN3, CD2AP, CASS4, and MS4A6E. Five most significant SMR genes were further validated through colocalization analysis. RIN3 is the only significant gene across all mentioned analyses and is a novel AD susceptibility gene at the genome-wide significance level. Druggability evaluation identified KCNQ3, HLA-DQB1, and RABEP1 as known genes previously targeted for drug development in neurological disorders, suggesting their potential therapeutic relevance in AD. © 2024 International Society for Neurochemistry.",
  "39650656": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent forms of dementia globally and remains an incurable condition that often leads to death. PANoptosis represents an emerging paradigm in programmed cell death, integrating three critical processes: pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Studies have shown that apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis play important roles in AD development. Therefore, targeting PANoptosis genes might lead to novel therapeutic targets and clinically relevant therapeutic approaches. This study aims to identify different molecular subtypes of AD and potential drugs for treating AD based on PANoptosis. METHODS: Differentially expressed PANoptosis genes associated with AD were identified via Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE48350, GSE5281, and GSE122063. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was employed to construct a risk model linked to these PANoptosis genes. Consensus clustering analysis was conducted to define AD subtypes based on these genes. We further performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA), functional enrichment analysis, and immune cell infiltration analysis to investigate differences between the identified AD subtypes. Additionally, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established to identify hub genes, and the DGIdb database was consulted to identify potential therapeutic compounds targeting these hub genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was utilized to assess differences in gene expression at the cellular level across subtypes. RESULTS: A total of 24 differentially expressed PANoptosis genes (APANRGs) were identified in AD, leading to the classification of two distinct AD subgroups. The results indicate that these subgroups exhibit varying disease progression states, with the early subtype primarily linked to dysfunctional synaptic signaling. Furthermore, we identified hub genes from the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two clusters and predicted 38 candidate drugs and compounds for early AD treatment based on these hub genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that key genes associated with the early subtype are predominantly expressed in neuronal cells, while the differential genes for the metabolic subtype are primarily found in endothelial cells and astrocytes. CONCLUSION: In summary, we identified two subtypes, including the AD early synaptic abnormality subtype as well as the immune-metabolic subtype. Additionally, ten hub genes, SLC17A7, SNAP25, GAD1, SLC17A6, SLC32A1, PVALB, SYP, GRIN2A, SLC12A5, and SYN2, were identified as marker genes for the early subtype.

This protein acts primarily as a glutathione-electrophile conjugate (GS-E) transporter, crucial for detoxifying hazardous compounds and converting them into mercapturic acids. RLIP76 also modulates cytoskeletal motility and membrane plasticity through its role in the Ral-signaling pathway, interacting with RalA and RalB, key small GTPases involved in growth and metastasis. Beyond its ATP-dependent transport functions in various tissues, RLIP76 also demonstrates GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) activity towards Rac1 and Cdc42, with a preference for Ral-GTP over Ral-GDP. Its functions span critical physiological processes including membrane dynamics, oxidative stress response, and mitochondrial dynamics. The protein's widespread expression and evolutionary conservation underscore its significance. Our lab discovered that Rlip interacts with Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteins, amyloid beta and phosphorylated and induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfnction and synaptic damage in AD. Our in vitro studies revealed that overexpression of Rlip reduces mitochondrial abnormalities. Further, our in vivo studies (Rlip+/- mice) revealed that a partial reduction of Rlip in mice (Rlip+/-), leads to mitochondrial abnormalities, elevated oxidative stress, and cognitive deficits resembling late-onset AD, emphasizing the protein's crucial role in neuronal health and disease. Finally, we discuss the experimental cross-breedings of overexpression of mice Rlip TG/TG or Rlip + /- mice with Alzheimer's disease models - earlyonset 5XFAD, late-onset APPKI and Tau transgenic mice, providing new insights into RLIP76's role in AD progression and development.

  "39610285": "BACKGROUND: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) modulate the synaptic proteome and are instrumental in maintaining synaptic homeostasis. Moreover, aberrant expression of an RBP in a disease state would have deleterious downstream effects on synaptic function. While many underlying mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been proposed, the contribution of RBPs has been relatively unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To investigate alterations in RBP-messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions in AD, and its overall impact on the disease-related proteome. METHODS: We first utilized RNA-immunoprecipitation to investigate interactions between RBP, DJ-1 (Parkinson's Disease protein 7) and target mRNAs in controls and AD. Surface Sensing of Translation - Proximity Ligation Assay (SUnSET-PLA) and western blotting additionally quantified alterations in mRNA translation and protein expression of DJ-1 targets. Finally, we utilized an unbiased bioinformatic approach that connects AD-related pathways to two RBPs, DJ-1 and FMRP (Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1). RESULTS: We find that oligomeric DJ-1 in AD donor synapses were less dynamic in their ability to bind and unbind mRNA compared to synapses from cognitively unimpaired, neuropathologically-verified controls. Furthermore, we find that DJ-1 associates with the mRNA coding for FMRP, Fmr1, leading to its reduced synaptic expression in AD. Through the construction of protein-protein interaction networks, aberrant expression of DJ-1 and FMRP are predicted to lead to the upregulation of key AD-related pathways, such as thyroid hormone stimulating pathway, autophagy, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. CONCLUSIONS: DJ-1 and FMRP are novel targets that may restore established neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD.",
  "39608728": "Neuroinflammation is closely related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of its prominent cellular components, microglia, is a potent coordinator of neuroinflammation in interplay with the characteristic AD pathological alterations including Aβ, tau, and neuronal defects, which constitute the AD-unique extracellular microenvironment. Mounting evidence implicates Triggering Receptors Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) in the center of microglial activation, a vital event in the pathogenesis of AD. TREM2 is a pivotal microglial receptor that interacts with specific elements present in the AD microenvironment and induces microglial intracellular signallings contributing to phagocytosis, migration, cytokine production, metabolism, and survival, which shapes the microglial activation profile. It follows that TREM2 builds up a bridge between microglia and the extracellular microenvironment. This review illustrates how TREM2 modulates microglia to affect AD pathogenesis. Mainly presented facets in the review are i. the development of AD-specific microglial phenotypes (disease-associated microglia, DAM), ii. microglial interactions with major AD pathologies, and iii. the underlying intracellular signallings of microglial activation. Also, outstanding controversies regarding the nature of neuroinflammation are discussed.

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive microarray analysis of gene expression data from hippocampus tissue in AD patients and control samples using three microarray datasets (GSE1297, GSE28146, and GSE29378) collected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The datasets were pre-processed and normalized, revealing 346 significant genes, 103 of which were upregulated and 243 downregulated. The PPI network of significant genes was constructed to detect the top 50 hub genes, which were then further analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG), and GSEA, revealing 47 key genes involved in AD-related pathways. These key genes were then subjected to feed forward loop (FFL) motif analysis for the prediction of transcriptional factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) mediated gene regulatory networks.

A protein‒protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING platform, and core targets were identified through topological analysis using Cytoscape software. Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the relevant targets were performed using the Metascape database. The main active ingredients of JDYZF and potential core targets were identified based on degree values. Molecular docking technology was used to verify the interactions between the main active ingredients and potential core targets. Furthermore, water maze tests and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of brain and liver tissues were performed to evaluate the effects of JDYZF on cognitive dysfunction in AD mice and neuronal damage in hippocampal brain tissue and to assess drug toxicity. PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 and to investigate the effect of JDYZF on hippocampal apoptosis in AD mice. Results. One hundred twelve core PPI target proteins, including CASP3, TP53, and VEGFA, were found between JDYZF and AD. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment of the MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and so on. Water maze tests revealed that the high-dose JDYZF treatment significantly improved the escape latency of AD model mice. The HE staining results showed that JDYZF exerted a protective effect on neuronal damage in the hippocampus of AD mice. JDYZF could upregulate the expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 while downregulating the expression of the proapoptotic factors Bax and caspase-3. Conclusion. JDYZF can improve the cognitive function of AD mice by suppressing cell apoptosis. © 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",
  "39574639": "Single-cell omics is advancing our understanding of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing specific subtypes that are either susceptible or resilient to neurodegeneration. Using single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics to compare neocortical regions affected early (prefrontal cortex and precuneus) or late (primary visual cortex) in AD, we identified a resilient excitatory population in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex expressing RORB, CUX2, and EYA4. Layer 4 neurons in association neocortex also remained relatively preserved as AD progressed and shared overlapping molecular signatures of resilience. Early in the disease, resilient neurons upregulated genes associated with synapse maintenance, synaptic plasticity, calcium homeostasis, and neuroprotective factors, including GRIN2A, RORA, NRXN1, NLGN1, NCAM2, FGF14, NRG3, NEGR1, and CSMD1. We also identified KCNIP4, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel-interacting protein that interacts with Kv4.2 channels and presenilins, as a key factor linked to resilience. KCNIP4 was consistently upregulated in the early stages of pathology. Furthermore, AAV-mediated overexpression of Kcnip4 in a humanized AD mouse model reduced the expression of the activity-dependent genes Arc and c-Fos, suggesting compensatory mechanisms against neuronal hyperexcitability. Our dataset provides a valuable resource for investigating mechanisms underlying resilience to neurodegeneration.",
  "39573865": "BACKGROUND: Handgrip strength correlates with cognitive function, but how gender and dietary protein interact with it is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between handgrip strength and cognitive function among non-stroke elders, and potential interaction effects of gender and dietary protein. METHODS: Non-stroke older adults with handgrip strength and cognitive tests available were included from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to explore the association between grip strength and cognitive performance. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were to investigate the effect of weak handgrip strength on cognitive impairment. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore differences among sub-populations. Interaction effects of gender and protein intake were investigated by interaction analyses. RESULTS: Larger handgrip strength was associated with preferable memory function in men (CERAD Word Learning sub-test: p = 0.005; CERAD Delayed Recall: p = 0.009), better verbal fluency (Animal Fluency test: p = 0.005) and executive function in women (Digit Symbol Substitution Test: p = 0.017). Weak handgrip strength was associated with cognitive impairment, especially in older, female, obese participants or elders with low protein consumption. Participants with weak grip strength, compared to normal strength, were twice as likely to perform poorly in complex cognition evaluations (odds ratio = 2.01, p = 0.028). Interaction effect of protein intake was observed (p-interaction = 0.022). Compared to conditions of low protein intake, high protein intake significantly offset the impact of weak handgrip on cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The association between grip strength and cognitive performance varies by gender. Non-stroke elders with weak handgrip strength are vulnerable to cognitive impairment. Improving muscle strength and increasing protein intake may be effective to mitigate decline in executive function.",
  "39570454": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. It is also known to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating the body's metabolism and is responsible for activating the Phosphoinotide-3-Kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. This pathway is activated when insulin binds to the insulin receptor on nerve cells, and it helps regulate the metabolism of glucose and lipids. Dysfunction in the insulin signaling pathway can lead to a decrease in brain insulin levels and insulin sensitivity, thereby inducing disruptions in insulin signal transduction and leading to disorders in brain energy metabolism. Moreover, these dysfunctions also contribute to the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein, both of which are characteristic features of AD. Therefore, this article focuses on insulin resistance to reveal the complex mechanism between brain insulin resistance and AD occurrence in T2DM. On this basis, this article further summarizes the biological effects and mechanisms of antidiabetic drugs on the two diseases, aiming to provide new ideas for the discovery of drugs for the treatment of T2DM combined with AD. © 2024.

  "39567476": "The complex kinetics of disease-related amyloid aggregation of proteins such as α-Synuclein (α-Syn) in Parkinson's disease and Aβ42 in Alzheimer's disease include primary nucleation, amyloid fibril elongation and secondary nucleation. The latter can be a key accelerator of the aggregation process. It has been demonstrated that the chaperone domain BRICHOS can interfere with the secondary nucleation process of Aβ42. Here, we explore the mechanism of secondary nucleation inhibition of the BRICHOS domain of the lung surfactant protein (proSP-C) against α-Syn aggregation and amyloid formation. We determine the 3D NMR structure of an inactive trimer of proSP-C BRICHOS and its active monomer using a designed mutant. Furthermore, the interaction between the proSP-C BRICHOS chaperone and a substrate peptide has been studied. NMR-based interaction studies of proSP-C BRICHOS with α-Syn fibrils show that proSP-C BRICHOS binds to the C-terminal flexible fuzzy coat of the fibrils, which is the secondary nucleation site on the fibrils. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that proSP-C BRICHOS runs along the fibrillar axis diffusion-dependently sweeping off monomeric α-Syn from the fibrils. The observed mechanism explains how a weakly binding chaperone can inhibit the α-Syn secondary nucleation pathway via avidity where a single proSP-C BRICHOS molecule is sufficient against up to ~7-40 α-Syn molecules embedded within the fibrils. © 2024.

  "39564883": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex psychiatric disorder presenting challenges for characterization. The current study aimed to identify and evaluate disease-responsive essential genes (DREGs) to enhance the molecular characterization of SCZ. RNA-sequencing data from PsychENCODE (536 SCZ patients, 832 controls) and peripheral blood transcriptome data from 144 recruited subjects (59 SCZ patients, 6 non-SCZ psychiatric patients, 79 controls) are analyzed. Shared differential expression genes are obtained using three algorithms. Support vector machine (SVM)-based recursive feature elimination is employed to identify DREGs. The biological relevance of these DREGs is examined through protein-protein interaction network, pathway enrichment, polygenic scoring, and brain tissue expression. Key DREGs are validated in SCZ animal models. A DREGs-based machine-learning model for SCZ characterization is developed and its performance is assessed using multiple datasets. The analysis identified 184 DREGs forming an interconnected network involved in synaptic plasticity, inflammation, neuronal development, and neurotransmission. DREGs exhibited distinct expression in SCZ-related brain regions and animal models. Their genetic contributions are comparable to genome-wide polygenic risk scores. The DREG-based SVM model demonstrated high performance (AUC 85% for SCZ characterization, 79% for specificity). These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SCZ and emphasize the potential of DREGs in improving SCZ characterization. © 2024 The Author(s).

  "39559760": "Tachykinins are short neuropeptides, such as substance P and neurokinin B, that have been shown to interact with Alzheimer's β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide. Neurokinin A (NKA) is a secreted tachykinin neuropeptide that binds to neurokinin receptors and with an emerging role in the brain-gut axis. NKA shares the brain niche with Aβ; thus, we investigate whether and how NKA and Aβ peptide interact. We have used a combination of computational and experimental biophysics to assess the interaction of both peptides in vitro. Using Phe-to-Trp substitution, we have shown that Phe in the FXGLM signature in NKA is important for such interaction and for the modulation of the Aβ peptide amyloid cascade. Besides, cellular experiments have shown that the NKA-Aβ interaction decreases the Aβ peptide toxicity. Altogether, our work raises the intriguing possibility that NKA balance and the NKA-Aβ peptide interplay are relevant in the aggregation process in Alzheimer's disease. © 2024 The Authors.

  "39556154": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a longstanding health challenge, prompting a century-long exploration into its etiology and progression. Despite significant advancements in medical science, current AD treatments provide only symptomatic relief, urging a shift towards innovative paradigms. This study, departing from the amyloid hypothesis, integrates Systems Pharmacology, Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamic Simulations to investigate a polyherbal phytoformulation (US 7,273,626 B2) rooted in Ayurveda for AD, consisting of Bacopa monnieri, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Dioscorea bulbifera (BHD). Diosgenin emerges as a crucial compound, aligning with previous studies, yet recognizing its limitations in explaining BHD's mechanism, this research delves into the intricate network of interactions. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis identifies hub genes (ALOX5, GSK3B, ACHE, SRC, AKT1, EGFR, PIK3R1, ESR1 and APP), suggesting a systems-level modulation of AD. Enrichment analyses unveil 370 AD-associated genes and key terms like \"Cellular Response to Chemical Stimulus\" and \"Regulation of Biological Quality.\" KEGG pathway analysis underscores BHD's potential in Alzheimer's disease pathway (hsa05010), Endocrine resistance (hsa01522), and PI3K-Akt signaling (hsa04151). Molecular docking, carefully selecting compounds (Kaempferol, Quercetin, Myricetin, Isorhamnetin, Beta-Sitosterol, Stigmasterol, Emodin and Diosgenin) and top modulated targets, validates interactions with high dock scores, providing promising therapeutic avenues. Two core targets, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1), were identified for further investigation due to their critical roles in Alzheimer's disease. To validate the molecular docking results, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the AChE complexes with Myricetin, Beta-Sitosterol, and Stigmasterol, as well as the ESR1 complexes with Emodin, Diosgenin, and Beta-Sitosterol. These simulations were then compared to the interactions observed with the marketed drugs Donepezil and Estradiol, which are commonly used in Alzheimer's treatment. The MD simulations provided detailed insights into the stability and behavior of these complexes over time. The findings indicated that Myricetin and Emodin not only maintained stable interactions with AChE and ESR1 but also exhibited greater stability than Donepezil and Estradiol at specific time points and protein regions, as demonstrated by lower RMSD and RMSF values. These results suggest that natural compounds hold promise as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, offering new avenues for drug development, while the formulation BHD shows potential as an adjuvant in integrative medicine alongside standard Alzheimer's treatments, effectively targeting related pathways and genes. © 2024.

  "39554095": "BACKGROUND: Although interactions between amyloid-beta and tau proteins have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the precise mechanisms by which these interactions contribute to disease progression are not yet fully understood. Moreover, despite the growing application of deep learning in various biomedical fields, its application in integrating networks to analyze disease mechanisms in AD research remains limited. In this study, we employed BIONIC, a deep learning-based network integration method, to integrate proteomics and protein-protein interaction data, with an aim to uncover factors that moderate the effects of the Aβ-tau interaction on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage AD. METHODS: Proteomic data from the ROSMAP cohort were integrated with protein-protein interaction (PPI) data using a Deep Learning-based model. Linear regression analysis was applied to histopathological and gene expression data, and mutual information was used to detect moderating factors. Statistical significance was determined using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Our results suggested that astrocytes and GPNMB+ microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction. Based on linear regression with histopathological and gene expression data, GFAP and IBA1 levels and GPNMB gene expression positively contributed to the interaction of tau with Aβ in non-dementia cases, replicating the results of the network analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that GPNMB+ microglia moderate the Aβ-tau interaction in early AD and therefore are a novel therapeutic target. To facilitate further research, we have made the integrated network available as a visualization tool for the scientific community (URL: https://igcore.cloud/GerOmics/AlzPPMap).",

Neuroinflammation is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Investigational and FDA approved drugs targeting inflammation already exist, thus drug repurposing for AD is a suitable approach. BT-11 is an investigational drug that reduces inflammation in the gut and improves cognitive function. BT-11 is orally active and binds to lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2), a glutathione-s-transferase, thus potentially reducing oxidative stress. We investigated the effects of BT-11 long-term treatment on the TgF344-AD rat model. BT-11 reduced hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits, Aβ plaque load and neuronal loss in males, and mitigated microglia numbers in females. BT-11 treatment led to hippocampal transcriptomic changes in signaling receptor, including G-protein coupled receptor pathways. We detected LANCL2 in hippocampal nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions with potential different post-translational modifications, suggesting distinct functions based on its subcellular localization. LANCL2 was present in oligodendrocytes, showing a role in oligodendrocyte function. To our knowledge, these last two findings have not been reported. Overall, our data suggest that targeting LANCL2 with BT-11 improves cognition and reduces AD-like pathology by potentially modulating G-protein signaling and oligodendrocyte function. Our studies contribute to the field of novel immunomodulatory AD therapeutics, and merit further research on the role of LANCL2 in this disease.",

  "39551139": "Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a multimodal chaperone protein that is implicated in various pathophysiological conditions including drug addiction, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). S1R interacts with various ion channels and receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane (PM). It has been reported that S1R colocalizes with the M2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) on the soma of motoneurons, although a functional interaction between these two proteins has not been established. Here, we investigated the regulation of M2R signaling by S1R using electrophysiological recordings of GIRK currents in HEK293T cells. We observed that S1R strongly inhibited M2R-mediated activation of GIRK1/2, but the disease mutant linked to ALS, S1R E102Q, did not. The inhibitory effect of S1R was selective for M2R and wasn't seen when S1R was co-expressed with other Gi/o coupled receptors including M4R. Chimeric and mutant receptors of M2R and M4R were generated and analyzed, and this highlighted Ala401 in the transmembrane 6 domain (TM6) of M2R and Glu172 as well as Glu175 in the extracellular loop 2 regions of M2R, as essential for the inhibition by S1R. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the physical interaction between M2R and S1R. Immunocytochemical labeling of M2R and S1R expressed in HeLa cells, HEK293T cells, and cultured hippocampal neurons, showed clear PM expression of M2R throughout the cell which was decreased by coexpression with S1R but was still apparent. Taken together, our results show that S1R interacts with M2R to reduce both its PM expression and function, and this involves TM6 and the extracellular loop 2.",

We show that several cancer-associated mutations, and a mutation derived from Alzheimer's Disease patients, diminish the ability of Mig6 to bind and inhibit EGFR in vitro. In mammalian cells, the mutations decreased the Mig6-induced suppression of basal and EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation, MAP kinase phosphorylation, and cell migration.

  "39528445": "The therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are limited, underscoring the critical need for finding an effective regulator of Aβ42 production. In this study, with 489 human postmortem brains, we revealed that homotrimer G protein subunit gamma 5 (GNG5) expression is upregulated in the hippocampal-entorhinal region of pathological AD compared with normal controls, and is positively correlated with Aβ pathology. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that increased GNG5 significantly promotes Aβ pathology and Aβ42 production. Mechanically, GNG5 regulates the cleavage preference of γ-secretase towards Aβ42 by directly interacting with the γ-secretase catalytic subunit presenilin 1 (PS1). Moreover, excessive GNG5 increases the protein levels and the activation of Rab5, leading to the increased number of early endosomes, the major cellular organelle for production of Aβ42. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence revealed co-interaction of Aβ42 with GPCR family CXCR2, which is known as the receptor for IL-8, thus facilitating the dissociation of G-proteins βγ from α subunits. Treatment of Aβ42 in neurons combined with structure prediction indicated Aβ42 oligomers as a new ligand of CXCR2, upregulating γ subunit GNG5 protein levels. The co-localizations of GNG5 and PS1, CXCR2 and Aβ42 were verified in eight human brain regions. Besides, GNG5 is significantly reduced in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cerebral cortex or serum of AD patients compared with healthy cognition controls. In brief, GNG5 is a novel regulator of Aβ42 production, suggesting its clinical potential as a diagnosis biomarker and the therapeutic target for AD. The GNG5 content in EVs derived from serum and brain tissue of patients with AD significantly reduced. The GNG5 expression in the hippocampal-entorhinal neurons of donors with pathological AD significantly increased, and can exist in homotrimer subtypes. GNG5 expression positively correlates with Aβ pathology and Aβ42 production. Homotrimer-GNG5 binds to the γ-secretase catalytic subunit PS1 and preferentially generates Aβ42 in early endosome. GNG5 leads to enhanced Rab5 protein and activation levels, increased number of early endosome, promoting Aβ42 production. Further, Aβ42 binds to CXCR2 to upregulate GNG5 levels in a feedback loop. © 2024. The Author(s).",

We mapped these genes on a human protein-protein interaction network to discover subnetworks perturbed by AD. Our results show that utilizing gene pathogenicity information from RNA-Seq data positively contributes to the disclosure of AD-related mechanisms. Moreover, dividing the discovered subnetworks into highly connected modules reveals a clearer picture of altered molecular pathways that, otherwise, would not be captured.

Epidemiological data indicate an inverse relationship between AD and various cancers. Accordingly, this study seeks to analyze the negatively correlated genes between AD and ovarian cancer and identify closely related compounds through virtual screening technology to explore potential therapeutic drugs. METHODS: Microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and negatively correlated genes between AD and ovarian cancer were identified using bioinformatics analysis. Clinical prognostic and survival analyses were performed to identify genes most negatively associated with these diseases. The top ten compounds with the strongest binding to the target genes were screened from the ChemDiv database using virtual screening technology, considering the blood-brain barrier. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to identify potential sites for the binding of these compounds to the target protein MX1. Additionally, point mutation analysis of the target protein was performed. Finally, the binding site was verified in vitro. RESULTS: The MX1 gene was most significantly negatively associated with AD and ovarian cancer. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed intersection sites at Glu-227 and Gly-188, where MX1 binds tightly to the head compound.

  "39503755": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder leading to cognitive deficits. Salidroside (Sal), a primary bioactive ingredient extracted from the roots of Rhodiola rosea L., has potent neuroprotective effects in AD. However, studies on potential targets for Sal-anchored AD are limited. In this study, we combined network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and experimental validation to identify potential targets of Sal treating AD. First, we screened 10 pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in Sal and AD using public databases. Then, we used Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis to explore the biological functions of the shared PRGs (Sal and AD). This finding exhibited that pathways linked to inflammation, like the nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors signaling pathway, are important for Sal to help fight AD. The GeneMANIA functional results subsequently revealed an association between AD and the processes of inflammasome complex and inflammatory response. Additionally, nine hub genes were identified in the protein-protein interaction network of these shared PRGs. Subsequent analysis of the genes and phenotypes confirmed that these nine hub genes were directly correlated with AD. Subsequently, an in vitro AD model was created using rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) cells induced by amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) 25-35 (20 µM). Sal significantly reduced the pyroptosis caused by Aβ 25-35 in PC12 cells and decreased the expression levels of IL-1β, CASP1, IL-18, PYCARD, and NLRP3. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that Sal could stably bind to NLRP3. Druggability analysis revealed that Sal had excellent druggability. These results demonstrated that Sal could alleviate AD by targeting IL-1β, CASP1, IL-18, PYCARD, and NLRP3 to regulate the NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis signaling pathway. © 2024.

This study conducted a cross-transcriptomic analysis of AD using existing microarray datasets from the hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex (EC), comparing them with age-matched non-AD controls. Both of these brain regions are critical for learning and memory processing and are vulnerable areas that exhibit abnormalities in early AD. The cross-transcriptomic analysis identified 564 significantly differentially expressed genes in HC and 479 in EC. Among these, 151 genes were significantly differentially expressed in both tissues, with functions related to synaptic vesicle clustering, synaptic vesicle exocytosis/endocytosis, mitochondrial ATP synthesis, hydrogen ion transmembrane transport, and structural constituent of cytoskeleton, suggesting a potential association between cognitive decline in AD, synaptic vesicle dynamics, dysregulation of cytoskeleton organization, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further gene ontology analysis specific to the HC revealed the gene ontology enrichment in aerobic respiration, synaptic vesicle cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The enrichment analysis in CA1 of HC revealed differentiation in gene expression related to mitochondrial membrane functions involved in bioenergetics, mitochondrial electron transport, and biological processes associated with microtubule-based process, while analysis in the EC region showed enrichment in synaptic vesicle dynamics which is associated with neurotransmitter release and the regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential and synaptic transmission of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapse. Protein-protein interaction analysis highlighted central hub proteins predominantly expressed in mitochondria, involved in regulation of oxidative stress and ATP synthesis. These hub proteins interact not only within the mitochondria but also with proteins in the vesicular membrane and neuronal cytoskeleton, indicating a central role of mitochondria. This finding underscores the association between clinical symptoms and mitochondrial dysregulation of synaptic vesicle dynamics, cytoskeleton organization, and mitochondrial processes in both the HC and EC of AD.

  "39484489": "Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that consist of misfolded tau protein1 cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau pathology spreads cell-to-cell2 but the exact mechanisms of tau release and intercellular transmission remain poorly defined. Tau is released from neurons as free protein or in extracellular vesicles (EVs)3-5 but the role of these different release mechanisms in intercellular tau transmission is unclear. Here, we show that the neuronal gene Arc is critical for packaging tau into EVs. Brain EVs purified from human tau (hTau) transgenic rTg4510 mice (rTgWT) contain high levels of hTau that are capable of seeding tau pathology. In contrast, EVs purified from rTgWT crossed with Arc knock-out mice (rTgArc KO) have significantly less hTau and cannot seed tau aggregation. Arc facilitates the release of hTau in EVs produced via the I-BAR protein IRSp53, but not free tau. Arc protein directly binds hTau to form a fuzzy complex that we identified in both mouse and human brain tissue. We find that pathological intracellular hTau accumulates in neurons in rTgArc KO mice, which correlates with accelerated neuron loss in the hippocampus. Finally, we find that intercellular tau transmission is significantly abrogated in Arc KO mice. We conclude that Arc-dependent release of tau in EVs plays a significant role in intracellular tau elimination and intercellular tau transmission.",
  "39485716": "The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and overactivation of microglia contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the interaction between microglial activation and Aβ deposition in AD remains elusive. Here we revealed that Aβ activates microglia and promotes the release of Galectin-9 (Gal-9), a member of the β-galactoside-binding family of lectins. The levels of Gal-9 in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of AD patients are higher than those in control subjects. Gal-9 interacts with Aβ and promotes its aggregation, generating Gal-9-Aβ fibrils with enhanced seeding activity and neurotoxicity. The expression of Gal-9 increases with age in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Knockout of Gal-9 in APP/PS1 mice substantially reduced Aβ sedimentation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. Moreover, depletion of Gal-9 inhibited the seeding activity of brain homogenates from APP/PS1 mice. These findings reveal a mechanism by which microglia-derived Gal-9 accelerates Aβ aggregation and seeding in AD. Thus, strategies aimed at inhibiting Gal-9 may hold promise as a disease-modifying therapy to alleviate AD pathology. © 2024 The Author(s).

  "39479923": "The aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, particularly Aβ1-42, plays a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigate how dimerisation transforms the free energy surface (FES) of the Aβ1-42 monomer when it interacts with another Aβ1-42 peptide. We find that the monomer FES is a structurally inverted funnel with a disordered state at the global minimum. However, in the presence of a second Aβ1-42 peptide, the landscape becomes a folding funnel, leading to a β-hairpin state. Using first passage time analysis, we analyse the pathway for the transition from disordered to the β-hairpin state, which highlights the initial formation of a D23-K28 salt bridge as the driving force, together with hydrophobic contacts.",

  "39459522": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative condition marked by amyloid plaques, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss. Besides conventional medical care, herbal therapies, both raw and refined, have attracted researchers for their potential therapeutic effects. As a proof-of-concept, our study combined HPLC-DAD analysis of bioactive constituents, network pharmacology, molecular dynamics (MD), molecular docking, post-MD analysis, and experimental verification to investigate the mechanisms of crude drug formulations as a therapeutic strategy for AD. We identified nine bioactive compounds targeting 188 proteins and 1171 AD-associated genes. Using a Venn diagram, we found 47 overlapping targets, forming \"herb-compound-target (HCT)\" interaction networks and a protein‒protein interaction (PPI) network. Simulations analyzed binding interactions among the three core targets and their compounds. MD assessed the stability of the best-ranked poses and beneficial compounds for each protein. Among the top 22 hub genes, AChE, BChE, and MAO, ranked 10, 14, and 34, respectively, were selected for further analysis. Two tetraherbal formulations, Form A and Form B, showed notable activity against AChE. Form A exhibited significant (p < 0.0001) inhibitory activity (IC50 = 114.842 ± 2.084 µg/mL) compared to Form B (IC50 = 142.829 ± 4.258 µg/mL), though weaker than galantamine (IC50 = 27.950 ± 0.122 µg/mL). Form B had significant inhibitory effects on BChE (IC50 = 655.860 ± 32.812 µg/mL) compared to Form A (IC50 = 679.718 ± 20.656 µg/mL), but lower than galantamine (IC50 = 23.126 ± 0.683 µg/mL). Both forms protected against Fe2+-mediated brain injury by inhibiting MAO. Docking identified quercetin (-10.2 kcal/mol) and myricetin (-10.1 kcal/mol) for AChE; rutin (-10.6 kcal/mol) and quercetin (-9.7 kcal/mol) for BChE; and kaempferol (-9.1 kcal/mol) and quercetin (-8.9 kcal/mol) for MAO. These compounds were thermodynamically stable based on MD analysis. Collectively, the results offer a scientific rationale for the use of these specifically selected medicinal herbs as AD medications.",
  "39456697": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is expected to rise dramatically in incidence due to the global population aging. Traditional diagnostic approaches, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis and positron emission tomography, are expensive and invasive, limiting their routine clinical use. Recent advances in blood-based biomarkers, including amyloid-beta, phosphorylated tau, and neurofilament light, offer promising non-invasive alternatives for early AD detection and disease monitoring. This review synthesizes current research on these blood-based biomarkers, highlighting their potential to track AD pathology and enhance diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, this review uniquely integrates recent findings on protein-protein interaction networks and microRNA pathways, exploring novel combinations of proteomic, genomic, and epigenomic biomarkers that provide new insights into AD's molecular mechanisms. Additionally, we discuss the integration of these biomarkers with advanced neuroimaging techniques, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize AD diagnostics. Although large-scale validation is still needed, these biomarkers represent a critical advancement toward more accessible, cost-effective, and early diagnostic tools for AD.",
  "39447483": "Li+ based drugs have been used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders due to their mood stabilizing role for decades. Recently, several studies reported the protective effect of Li+ against severe neuropathologies such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease. Surprisingly, despite a broad range of Li+ effects on neurological conditions, little is known about its molecular mechanism. In this study, we propose that neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1), can be an effective molecular target for Li+ action. Here we show that the EF-hands in ApoNCS1 have submillimolar affinity for Li+ with Kd = 223 ± 19 μM. Li+ binding to ApoNCS1 quenches Trp emission intensity, suggesting distinct Trp sidechains environment in Li+NCS1 compared to ApoNCS1 and Ca2+NCS1. Li+ association also stabilizes the protein α-helical structure, in a similar way to Ca2+. Li+ association does not promote NCS1 dimerization. Association of Li+ increases NCS1 affinity for the D2R receptor binding peptide, in a similar way to Ca2+, however, the affinity of NCS1 for chlorpromazine is reduced with respect to Ca2+NCS1, possibly due to a decrease in solvent exposed hydrophobic area on the NCS1 surface in the presence of Li+. MD simulation data suggests that Li+ ions are coordinated by four oxygens from Asp and Glu sidechains and one carbonyl oxygen, in a similar way as reported previously for Li+ binding to DREAM. Overall, the data shows that Li+ binds to EF-hands of NCS1 and Li+NCS1 interactions may be involved in the potential neuroprotective role of Li+ against psychotic disorders.",

Binding to 3R and 4R tau in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is controversial. We aimed to investigate whether an FTP fluorescent analog (T726) can help shed light on this controversy. METHOD: We assessed T726 binding to amyloid beta (Aβ) and different tau isoforms in nine subjects (one control, three with Alzheimer's disease [AD], and five with FTLD) with different 3R and 4R tauopathies using fluorescence confocal microscopy. RESULTS: T726 did not colocalize with Aβ but showed significant co-localization with PHF tau in AD. We also observed some, albeit limited, co-localization of T726 with 3R and 4R tau lesions in FTLD. DISCUSSION: This study's findings support FTP binding to some 3R and 4R tau lesions in FTLD. Further studies are needed to understand the biology of why FTP binds some but not all FTLD tau lesions. HIGHLIGHTS: Flortaucipir analog (T726) showed significant co-localization with paired helical filament (PHF) tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Colocalization between T726 with 3R and 4R tau lesions was observed in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).

  "39431020": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) plays an essential role in microglia activation and is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target for modulation of microglia in several neurological diseases. In this study, we present the development and preclinical evaluation of 64Cu-labeled antibody-based PET radiotracers as tools for non-invasive assessment of TREM2 expression. Furthermore, we tested the potential of an antibody transport vehicle (ATV) that binds human transferrin receptor to facilitate transcytosis of TREM2 antibody-based radiotracers to the CNS and improve target engagement. Methods: A TREM2 antibody with an engineered transport vehicle (ATV:4D9) and without (4D9) were covalently modified with pNCS-benzyl-NODAGA and labeled with copper-64. Potency, stability, and specificity were assessed in vitro followed by in vivo PET imaging at the early 2 h, intermediate 20 h, and late imaging time points 40 h post-injection using a human transferrin receptor (hTfR) expressing model for amyloidogenesis (5xFAD;TfRmu/hu) or wild-type mice (WT;TfRmu/hu), and hTfR negative controls. Organs of interest were isolated to determine biodistribution by ex vivo autoradiography. Cell sorting after in vivo tracer injection was used to demonstrate cellular specificity for microglia and to validate TREM2 PET results in an independent mouse model for amyloidogenesis (AppSAA;TfRmu/hu). For translation to human imaging, a human TREM2 antibody (14D3) was radiolabeled and used for in vitro autoradiography on human brain sections. Results: The 64Cu-labeled antibodies were obtained in high radiochemical purity (RCP), radiochemical yield (RCY), and specific activity. Antibody modification did not impact TREM2 binding. ATV:4D9 binding proved to be specific, and the tracer stability was maintained over 48 h. The uptake of [64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-ATV:4D9 in the brains of hTfR expressing mice was up to 4.6-fold higher than [64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-4D9 in mice without hTfR. TREM2 PET revealed elevated uptake in the cortex of 5xFAD mice compared to wild-type, which was validated by autoradiography. PET-to-biodistribution correlation revealed that elevated radiotracer uptake in brains of 5xFAD;TfRmu/hu mice was driven by microglia-rich cortical and hippocampal brain regions. Radiolabeled ATV:4D9 was selectively enriched in microglia and cellular uptake explained PET signal enhancement in AppSAA;TfRmu/hu mice. Human autoradiography showed elevated TREM2 tracer binding in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: [64Cu]Cu-NODAGA-ATV:4D9 has potential for non-invasive assessment of TREM2 as a surrogate marker for microglia activation in vivo. ATV engineering for hTfR binding and transcytosis overcomes the blood-brain barrier restriction for antibody-based PET radiotracers. TREM2 PET might be a versatile tool for many applications beyond Alzheimer's disease, such as glioma and chronic inflammatory diseases. © The author(s).",
  "39427050": "Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) and intracranial aneurysm (IA) were two different types of diseases that occurred in the brain, ruptured IA (RIA) survivors may experience varying degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Neither AD nor IA is easily recognizable by an early onset so that the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes would be on the rise. Therefore, we focused on the exploration of the shared genes and molecular mechanisms between AD and IA, which would be significant for the efficiency of co-screening and co-diagnosis. Two GEO datasets were selected for the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed gene screening, obtaining 78 overlapped genes. Next, 9 hub genes were identified by the protein-protein interaction network, including PIK3CA, GAB1, IGF1R, PLCB1, PGR, PDGFRB, PLCE1, FGFR3, and SYNJ1. The interactions among the hub genes, miRNA, and TFs were also explored. Meanwhile, we performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses for the results of WGCNA and hub genes, which showed that the Ras signaling and Rap1 signaling were the main shared pathogenesis. In conclusion, the present bioinformatics analysis revealed that AD and IA had the shared genes and molecular mechanisms, and these outcomes were associated with inflammation and calcium homeostasis, which could provide research clues for further studies. © 2024.

  "39425207": "BACKGROUND: The activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an early pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, but how ER stress contributes to the onset and development of AD remains poorly characterized. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a non-canonical neurotrophic factor and an ER stress inducible protein. Previous studies reported that MANF is increased in the brains of both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic AD patients, but the consequence of the early rise in MANF protein is unknown. METHODS: We examined the expression of MANF in the brain of AD mouse models at different pathological stages. Through behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuropathological analyses, we assessed the level of synaptic dysfunctions in the MANF transgenic mouse model which overexpresses MANF in the brain and in wild type (WT) mice with MANF overexpression in the hippocampus. Using proteomic and transcriptomic screening, we identified and validated the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of MANF on synaptic function. RESULTS: We found that increased expression of MANF correlates with synapse loss in the hippocampus of AD mice. The ectopic expression of MANF in mice via transgenic or viral approaches causes synapse loss and defects in learning and memory. We also identified that MANF interacts with ELAV like RNA-binding protein 2 (ELAVL2) and affects its binding to RNA transcripts that are involved in synaptic functions. Increasing or decreasing MANF expression in the hippocampus of AD mice exacerbates or ameliorates the behavioral deficits and synaptic pathology, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study established MANF as a mechanistic link between ER stress and synapse loss in AD and hinted at MANF as a therapeutic target in AD treatment. © 2024. The Author(s).",
  "39424953": "Maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis is crucial for cell survival and organismal health, as evidenced by the links between mitochondrial dysfunction and various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that lncMtDloop, a non-coding RNA of unknown function encoded within the D-loop region of the mitochondrial genome, maintains mitochondrial RNA levels and function with age. lncMtDloop expression is decreased in the brains of both human AD patients and 3xTg AD mouse models. Furthermore, lncMtDloop binds to mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), facilitates TFAM recruitment to mtDNA promoters, and increases mitochondrial transcription. To allow lncMtDloop transport into mitochondria via the PNPASE-dependent trafficking pathway, we fused the 3'UTR localization sequence of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S12 (MRPS12) to its terminal end, generating a specified stem-loop structure. Introducing this allotropic lncMtDloop into AD model mice significantly improved mitochondrial function and morphology, and ameliorated AD-like pathology and behavioral deficits of AD model mice. Taken together, these data provide insights into lncMtDloop as a regulator of mitochondrial transcription and its contribution to Alzheimer's pathogenesis. © 2024. The Author(s).",
  "39417126": "BACKGROUND: Genetic research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has primarily focused on amyloid-β (Aβ) pathogenesis, with fewer studies exploring tau pathology. Elucidating the genetic basis of tau pathology could identify novel pathways in AD. METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study of tau standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from [18]F-flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET) images to identify genetic variants underlying Tau pathology. Genetic data and tau-SUVRs from [18]F-flortaucipir PET images were acquired from the A4 (311 with preclinical AD) and ADNI (280 cognitively normal, 76 with mild cognitive impairment, and 19 AD patients) studies. Circulating plasma proteins in UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKBPPP, N=54,129) were used to validate genetic findings. SNP genotypes were tested for association with Tau-SUVR levels adjusting for age, sex and population substructure variables. AD association of polygenic risk scores (PRS) of tau and amyloid-SUVRs were assessed. Causal effect of plasma protein levels on Tau pathology were tested using Mendelian randomization analyses. RESULTS: GWAS of tau-SUVR revealed two significant loci: rs78636169 (P=5.76×10-10) in JARID2 and rs7292124 (P=2.20×10-8) near ISX. Gene-based analysis of tau deposition highlighted APOE (P=2.55×10-6), CTNNA3 (P=2.86×10-6) and JARID2 (P=1.23×10-4), a component of the PRC2 multi-protein complex which regulates gene expression. Mendelian randomization analysis of available circulating plasma proteins in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKBPPP) identified LRRFIP1, a protein that binds with PRC2 multi-protein complex, as potentially causally linked to tau pathology. Genes associated with both amyloid and tau pathologies were enriched in endocytosis and signal transduction pathways. AD polygenic risk score (PRS) was associated with amyloid-SUVR but not with tau-SUVR. Amyloid-SUVR PRS had a notable association with AD clinical status, particularly in younger APOE-ε4 carriers, whereas tau-SUVR PRS showed a stronger association in older carriers. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel potential therapeutic target, JARID2 in the PRC2 multi-protein complex, for tau pathology. Furthermore, gene pathway analysis clarified the distinct roles of Aβ and tau in AD progression, underscoring the complexity of genetic influences across different stages of the disease.",
  "39409157": "Abnormal protein accumulations in the brain are linked to aging and the pathogenesis of dementia of various types, including Alzheimer's disease. These accumulations can be reduced by cell indigenous mechanisms. Among these is autophagy, whereby proteins are transferred to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagic dysfunction hampers the elimination of pathogenic protein aggregations that contribute to cell death. We had observed that the adhesion molecule L1 interacts with microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 (LC3), which is needed for autophagy substrate selection. L1 increases cell survival in an LC3-dependent manner via its extracellular LC3 interacting region (LIR). L1 also interacts with Aβ and reduces the Aβ plaque load in an AD model mouse. Based on these results, we investigated whether L1 could contribute to autophagy of aggregated Aβ and its clearance. We here show that L1 interacts with autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12) via its LIR domain, whereas interaction with ubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 does not depend on LIR. Aβ, bound to L1, is carried to the autophagosome leading to Aβ elimination. Showing that the mitophagy-related L1-70 fragment is ubiquitinated, we expect that the p62/SQSTM1 pathway also contributes to Aβ elimination. We propose that enhancing L1 functions may contribute to therapy in humans.",
  "39408788": "β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides form self-organizing fibrils in Alzheimer's disease. The biologically active, toxic Aβ25-35 fragment of the full-length Aβ-peptide forms a stable, oriented filament network on the mica surface with an epitaxial mechanism at the timescale of seconds. While many of the structural and dynamic features of the oriented Aβ25-35 fibrils have been investigated before, the β-strand arrangement of the fibrils and their exact orientation with respect to the mica lattice remained unknown. By using high-resolution atomic force microscopy, here, we show that the Aβ25-35 fibrils are oriented along the long diagonal of the oxygen hexagon of mica. To test the structure and stability of the oriented fibrils further, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations on model β-sheets. The models included the mica surface and a single fibril motif built from β-strands. We show that a sheet with parallel β-strands binds to the mica surface with its positively charged groups, but the C-terminals of the strands orient upward. In contrast, the model with antiparallel strands preserves its parallel orientation with the surface in the molecular dynamics simulation, suggesting that this model describes the first β-sheet layer of the mica-bound Aβ25-35 fibrils well. These results pave the way toward nanotechnological construction and applications for the designed amyloid peptides.",
  "39407708": "Despite the great effort that has gone into developing new molecules as multitarget compounds to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD), none of these have been approved to treat this disease. Therefore, it will be interesting to determine whether benzazoles such as benzimidazole, benzoxazole, and benzothiazole, employed as pharmacophores, could act as multitarget drugs. AD is a multifactorial disease in which several pharmacological targets have been identified-some are involved with amyloid beta (Aβ) production, such as beta secretase (BACE1) and beta amyloid aggregation, while others are involved with the cholinergic system as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butirylcholinesterase (BChE) and nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, as well as the hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein (tau). In this review, we describe the in silico and in vitro evaluation of benzazoles on three important targets in AD: AChE, BACE1, and Aβ. Benzothiazoles and benzimidazoles could be the best benzazoles to act as multitarget drugs for AD because they have been widely evaluated as AChE inhibitors, forming π-π interactions with W286, W86, Y72, and F338, as well as in the AChE gorge and catalytic site. In addition, the sulfur atom from benzothiazol interacts with S286 and the aromatic ring from W84, with these compounds having an IC50 value in the μM range. Also, benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles can inhibit Aβ aggregation. However, even though benzazoles have not been widely evaluated on BACE1, benzimidazoles evaluated in vitro showed an IC50 value in the nM range. Therefore, important chemical modifications could be considered to improve multitarget benzazoles' activity, such as substitutions in the aromatic ring with electron withdrawal at position five, or a linker 3 or 4 carbons in length, which would allow for better interaction with targets.",
  "39396906": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant alterations in hippocampal function and structure, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the hippocampal region remain elusive. We integrated multiple transcriptome datasets including human or rat hippocampus (GSE173955, GSE129051, GSE84422) to identify candidate genes. Subsequent analyses including gene ontology analysis and protein-protein interaction mapping were performed to identify key genes and pathways. We found that glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA-type subunit 3A (GRIN3A) and glutamate metabotropic receptor 8 (GRM8), which are related to the glutamatergic system, were the top two annotated genes and directly related to MAPT, which encodes a tau protein. Since there is no direct evidence of interaction between tauopathy and these genes in AD, further transcriptomic data (GSE125957, GSE56772) from tau transgenic mice and experimental validations through primary rat hippocampal neurons and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain organoids were performed. Interestingly, we identified that decreased NR3A (encoded by GRIN3A) and mGluR8 (encoded by GRM8) are correlated with tauopathy and loss of postsynaptic function in AD.

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify AD-related modular genes. The Venn analysis was performed to obtain module genes associated with apoptosis and cuproptosis. Besides, we conducted an enrichment analysis of overlapped genes and constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, followed by screening hub genes and those significantly associated with AD were used to construct models of apoptosis and cuproptosis, respectively. Further, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, decision curve analysis (DCA), and subgroup analysis were used to compare the AD prediction performance of two models. Finally, the accuracy and reliability of AD prediction models were verified by GSE26927. RESULTS: We obtained 42 module genes related to apoptosis and 9 module genes related to cuproptosis. The enrichment analysis results revealed MAPK signaling pathway as the common signaling pathway of apoptosis- and cuproptosis-related genes. Next, the hub genes associated with apoptosis (TRADD, FADD, BIRC2, and CASP2) and cuproptosis (MAP2K1, SLC31A1, and PDHB) in AD were identified, which were used to construct apoptosis and cuproptosis models to distinguish AD patients from the control group (P < 0.05). The ROC, DCA, and subgroup analysis results showed that apoptosis-related models and cuproptosis-related models had comparable ability in predicting AD. GSE26927 further confirmed that the two models have comparable predictive effects for AD. CONCLUSIONS: The cuproptosis model had a certain performance in predicting AD.

  "39387696": "A striking issue is the scarcity of imaging probes for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. For the development of Aβ biomarkers, a mitochondria targeting, de novo designed, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe Cou-AIE-TPP+ is constructed by engineering the aromatic coumarin framework into the bridge of electron donor-acceptor-donor tethered with a lipophilic cationic triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) group. The synthesized Cou-AIE-TPP+ probe exhibits biocompatibility, noncytotoxicity, and a huge Stokes shift (124 nm in PBS). Cou-AIE-TPP+ has respectable fluorescence augmentation inside the aggregated Aβ40 in comparison with monomeric Aβ40 with a high binding affinity (Kd = 83 nM) to Aβ40 aggregates, is capable of detecting the kinetics of amyloid aggregation, and is superior to the gold standard probe thioflavin T. Fluorescence lifetime and brightness are also augmented when the probe Cou-AIE-TPP+ binds with Aβ aggregates in PBS. Cou-AIE-TPP+ (λem 604 nm) selectively targets and images neuronal cell mitochondria, is useful to monitor mitochondrial morphology alteration and damage during Aβ40-induced neurotoxicity, recognizes neurotoxic Aβ fibrils, and is highly colocalized with thioflavin T, showing a decent Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91 in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. These findings indicate that the mitochondria targeting, de novo designed, functional AIE-based solvatofluorochromic Cou-AIE-TPP+ probe is a promising switch on biomarkers for fluorescence imaging of Aβ aggregates and to monitor mitochondrial morphology change and dysfunction during Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, which may offer imperative direction for the advancement of compelling AIE biomarkers for targeted early stage Aβ diagnosis in the future.",
  "39392030": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that impairs learning and memory, with high rates of mortality. Birch bark has been traditionally used in the treatment of various skin ailments. Betulin (BT) is a key compound of birch bark that exhibits diverse pharmacological benefits and therapeutic potential in AD. However, the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of BT in AD remain unclear. The present study aimed to predict the potential therapeutic targets of BT in the treatment of AD, and to determine the specific underlying molecular mechanisms through network pharmacology analysis and experimental validation. PharmMapper was used to predict the target genes of BT, and four disease databases were searched to screen for AD targets. The intersection targets were identified using the jveen website. Drug‑disease target protein‑protein interaction networks and hub genes were obtained and visualized using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database and Cytoscape. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, and AutoDock was used for molecular docking analysis of BT and hub genes. Subsequently, the network‑predicted mechanisms of BT in AD were verified in vitro. A total of 495 BT and 1,386 AD targets were identified, and 120 were identified as potential targets of BT in the treatment of AD. The results of the molecular docking analysis revealed a strong binding affinity between BT and the hub genes. In addition, enrichment analyses of GO and KEGG pathways indicated that the neuroprotective effects of BT mainly involved the 'PI3K‑Akt signaling pathway'. The results of in vitro experiments demonstrated that pretreatment with BT for 2 h may ameliorate formaldehyde (FA)‑induced cytotoxicity and morphological changes in HT22 cells, and decrease FA‑induced Tau hyperphosphorylation and reactive oxygen species levels. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was activated and the expression levels of downstream proteins, namely GSK3β, Bcl‑2 and Bax, were modified following pre‑treatment with BT.

RESULTS: From LCMS/MS analysis data, 29 compounds were considered based on compound intensity and accuracy (>95 %). Then, 41 common gene targets were identified from AD genes and compound-targeted genes. The 41 common genes in the PPI network suggested that AChE and BACE1 were the most abundant proteins. Further, docking studies revealed the hit compound P4 binding interaction and energies when compared to other 28 ligands. The molecular dynamics studies showed that P4-AChE and P4-BACE1 complexes were stable, and there were no RMSD and RMSF fluctuations were observed up to 100 ns. Further, PCA and MM-GBSA analysis data supported that complexes (P4-AChE and P4-BACE1) were stable. The DFT and surface properties indicated that compound P4 was ideal candidate for AD treatment and must be considered for further biological activity studies. CONCLUSION: The study identified compound P4 (dehydropipernonaline) from alkaloidal fraction of Piper nigrum fruits, suggesting it may be hit candidate for AD treatment.",
  "39378784": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a tauopathy characterized by the deposition of amyloid aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the brain. Nevertheless, a soluble, oligomeric forms of Tau and Aβ are considered to be the most neurotoxic species responsible for neurodegenerative processes in AD. The mechanism of action of these oligomers remains largely unclear. Previously, we demonstrated the inhibition of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa) by Aβ. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effect of Tau protein on the BKCa activity. Furthermore, since prion protein (PrP) interacts with Tau and the N-terminal fragment of PrP, called N1, can be neuroprotective in tauopathies, we checked whether N1 can also act at the level of BKCa channel. In the studies we used monomers, oligomers and amyloid fibrils of aggregation-prone Tau fragment, called K18, carrying tauopathy-associated mutation - deletion of Lys280 (K18Δ280). Additionally, to induce formation of neurotoxic oligomers, K18Δ280 was phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). The activity of the plasma membrane BKCa of hippocampal neurons was recorded using single-channel patch-clamp technique in both inside-out and outside-out modes, exposing the cytosolic or extracellular surface of the membrane, respectively. In the outside-out mode - performing the extracellular application of the neurotoxic oligomers of phosphorylated K18Δ280, we observed a significant and concentration-dependent decrease in the probability of opening (Po) of BKCa. The Po of BKCa was fully recovered after washing the oligomers out. In the case of the inside-out patch-clamp configuration, we found that the Po of BKCa was not affected by the oligomers. In contrast to the oligomers, the monomers and amyloid fibrils of K18Δ280 had no effect on the channel activity, analyzed in inside-out as well as outside-out modes. Noteworthy, upon incubation with N1, the oligomers did not inhibit BKCa channel. The BKCa channel inhibition, dependent on the outside-out membrane orientation, implies specific interaction of the oligomers with the extracellular part of the channel. Moreover, our results suggest that N1 can convert the neurotoxic oligomers of Tau into a form which is not able to inhibit the channel, and indicate novel possible neuroprotective mechanism of PrP action in AD and other tauopathies.",
  "39377264": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all major cell types of the brain, providing a mode of intercellular communication and a pathway for disposal of cellular debris. EVs help maintain healthy brain function, but may also contribute to diseases affecting the brain. EVs might contribute to aging of the brain, as aging-related processes such as inflammation and cellular senescence may alter EV cargo, promoting further inflammation and senescence. However, the effects of aging on brain EVs and the function of EVs in the aging brain remain poorly understood. To address this question, we measured the levels and protein cargo of EVs isolated from the brains of 4-, 12-, and 22-month-old C57BL/6J mice. We detected no changes in EV levels, but observed age-dependent changes in EV proteins. EV fractions from aged (22 month old) brains contained higher levels of extracellular matrix proteins than EV fractions from young (4 month old) brains, with intermediate levels in 12-month-old brains. Specifically, EV fractions from aged mice contained elevated levels of hyaluronan and proteoglycan link proteins 1 and 2 and several chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Analysis of extracellular matrix in several brain regions of aged mice revealed increased immunolabeling for the CSPG aggrecan, but reduced labeling with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin, which binds to chondroitin sulfate side chains of CSPGs. These data are consistent with prior studies showing changes to the composition of extracellular matrix in aged brains, and indicate a novel association of EVs with changes in the extracellular matrix of the aging brain. © 2024 The Author(s).

  "39375405": "With the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) combined with cognitive impairment and aging has become one of the common and important complications of diabetes mellitus, which seriously affects the quality of life of the patients, and imposes a heavy burden on the patients' families and the society. Currently, there are no special measures for the treatment of cognitive impairment and aging in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the search for potential biological markers of type 2 diabetes mellitus combined with cognitive impairment and aging is of great significance for future precisive treatment. We downloaded three gene expression datasets from the GEO database: GSE161355 (related to T2D with cognitive impairment and aging), GSE122063, and GSE5281 (related to Alzheimer's disease). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database, and the top 15 hub genes were identified using the CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape. Core genes were ultimately determined using three machine learning methods: LASSO regression, Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The diagnostic performance of these genes was assessed using ROC curve analysis and validated in an independent dataset (GSE5281). Regulatory genes related to ferroptosis were screened from the FerrDb database, and their biological functions were further explored through GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Finally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze immune cell infiltration, and the correlation between core genes and immune cell infiltration levels was calculated, leading to the construction of an mRNA-miRNA regulatory network. In the GSE161355 and GSE122063 datasets, 217 common DEGs were identified. GSEA analysis revealed their enrichment in the PI3K-PLC-TRK signaling pathway, TP53 regulation of metabolic genes pathway, Notch signaling pathway, among others. PPI network analysis identified 15 candidate core genes, and further selection using LASSO, LDA, and SVM-RFE machine learning algorithms resulted in 6 core genes: BCL6, TP53, HSP90AA1, CRYAB, IL1B, and DNAJB1. ROC curve analysis indicated that these genes had good diagnostic performance in the GSE161355 dataset, with TP53 and IL1B achieving an AUC of 0.9, indicating the highest predictive accuracy. BCL6, HSP90AA1, CRYAB, and DNAJB1 also had AUCs greater than 0.8, demonstrating moderate predictive accuracy. Validation in the independent dataset GSE5281 showed that these core genes also had good diagnostic performance in Alzheimer's disease samples (AUC > 0.6). Ferroptosis-related analysis revealed that IL1B and TP53 play significant roles in apoptosis and immune response. Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that IL1B is significantly positively correlated with infiltration levels of monocytes and NK cells, while TP53 is significantly negatively correlated with infiltration levels of follicular helper T cells. The construction of the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network suggested that miR-150a-5p might play a key role in the regulation of T2D-associated cognitive impairment and aging by TP53. This study, by integrating bioinformatics and machine learning methods, identified BCL6, TP53, HSP90AA1, CRYAB, IL1B, and DNAJB1 as potential diagnostic biomarkers for T2D with cognitive impairment and aging, with a particular emphasis on the significance of TP53 and IL1B in immune cell infiltration. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes to cognitive impairment and aging, providing new targets for early diagnosis and treatment, but also offer new directions and targets for basic research. © 2024.

  "39370248": "In the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the amyloid hypothesis, which posits that amyloid β-protein (Aβ) abnormally aggregates and damages neurons with tau, has been proposed. It was originally thought that the accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils in the brain leads to AD-inducing neurotoxicity; however, in recent years, the positioning of early and intermediate aggregates has also been emphasized. In particular, following the positive results of phase 3 clinical trials of lecanemab and its approval in Japan and the United States, the pathology of protofibrils, which are the target molecules of lecanemab, has attracted attention. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy, we have previously reported that lecanemab, which has a high affinity for protofibrils, binds to and surrounds them. Donanemab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody that primarily targets fibrils composed of N3pG Aβ, has also attracted attention because of its efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials in patients with early stage AD.",
  "39362584": "AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and neuroinflammation, leading to progressive synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Recent evidence suggests that Galectin-3 (Gal-3) plays a critical role in Aβ pathogenesis. However, strategies to simultaneously target Gal-3 and Aβ are currently insufficient. This study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of (E)-2-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)-3-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one (D30), in reducing Gal-3 and Aβ pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied exogenous oligomeric Aβ and used 5 × FAD mice to assess the impact of Aβ on Gal-3 deposition, microglial activation, and cognitive function. Thy1-EGFP mice were employed to observe dendritic spines. Comprehensive evaluations of D30's effects included behavioral studies, transcriptomic analysis, Western blotting, and immunofluorescent staining. The interaction between D30 and Gal-3 was examined using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and microscale thermophoresis (MST). KEY FINDINGS: D30 effectively reduced Aβ monomer production by inhibiting Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) expression, and decreased Aβ aggregation. Treatment with D30 improved cognitive functions, reversed dendritic spine loss, and increased PSD95 expression in 5 × FAD mice. Additionally, D30 significantly lowered Gal-3 levels in both plasma and hippocampal tissues. D30 binds to Gal-3 and disrupts the interaction between Gal-3 and TREM2, as confirmed by FRET and MST. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings underscore the interaction between Gal-3 and Aβ in AD and its role in systemic inflammation using the 5 × FAD mouse model. Being able to target and regulate Gal-3 together with Aβ is crucial for preventing neuroinflammation and protecting synapses, D30 emerged as a novel compound with promising potential for AD treatment.",
  "39355983": "Human calcitonin (hCT) is an endogenous polypeptide commonly employed in treating bone resorption-related illnesses, but its clinical application is limited due to its high aggregation tendency. Metalloporphyrins are effective in suppressing amyloid fibrillation, positioning them as potential drug candidates for amyloidogenic disorders like Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes. In this work, we investigated the effects of Fe(III) meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphine chloride (FeTPPS), a highly efficient ONOO- decomposition catalyst, on hCT aggregation. Our findings reveal that FeTPPS effectively precludes hCT fibrillation by stabilizing the monomers and delaying the structural transition from α-helix bundles to β-sheet-rich aggregates. The macrocyclic ring of FeTPPS plays a significant role in disrupting hCT self-associations. Among various porphyrin analogs, those with an iron center and negatively charged peripheral substituents exhibit a stronger inhibitory effect on hCT aggregation. Spectroscopic analyses and computational simulations indicate that FeTPPS binds to hCT's core aggregation region via complexation with His20 in a 1 : 1 molar ratio. Hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking with the residues involving Tyr12, Phe19, and Ala26 also contribute to the interactions. Collectively, our study provides a promising approach for developing novel hCT drug formulations and offers theoretical guidance for designing metalloporphyrin-based inhibitors for various amyloidosis conditions.",
  "39354671": "Tau interacts with multiple heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs)-a family of RNA binding proteins that regulate multiple known cellular functions, including mRNA splicing, mRNA transport, and translation regulation. We have previously demonstrated particularly significant interactions between phosphorylated tau and three hnRNPs (hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2B1, and hnRNP K). Although multiple hnRNPs have been previously implicated in tauopathies, knowledge of whether these hnRNPs colocalize with tau aggregates or show cellular mislocalization in disease is limited. Here, we performed a neuropathological study examining the colocalization between hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2B1, hnRNP K, and phosphorylated tau in two brain regions (hippocampus and frontal cortex) in six disease groups (Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, and controls). Contrary to expectations, hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2B1, and hnRNP K did not colocalize with AT8-immunoreactive phosphorylated tau pathology in any of the tauopathies examined. However, we did observe significant cellular mislocalization of hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2B1 and hnRNP K in tauopathies, with unique patterns of mislocalization observed for each hnRNP. These data point to broad dysregulation of hnRNP A1, A2B1 and K across tauopathies with implications for disease processes and RNA regulation. © 2024 The Author(s).

  "39351804": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease without any effective preventive or therapeutic drugs. Natural products with stable structures and pharmacological characteristics are valuable sources for the development of novel drugs for many complex diseases. This study aimed to discover potential natural compounds for the treatment of AD using new technologies and methods and explore the efficacy and mechanism of candidate compounds. AD-related large-scale genetic datasets were collated to construct disease-PPIs and natural products were collected from six databases to construct compound-protein interactions (CPIs). Potential relationships between natural compounds and AD were predicted via network proximity and gene enrichment analyses. Then, five AD-related cell models and d-galactose-induced aging rat model were established to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of candidate compounds in vitro and in vivo. We identified that 267 natural compounds were predicted to have close connections with AD and 19 compounds could exert protective effect in at least one cell model. Notably, purpurin exerted protective effect in three cell models and significantly improved the cognitive learning and memory functions, reduced the oxidative stress injuries and neuroinflammation, and enhanced the synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic effect in the brain of d-galactose-treated rats. In this study, AD-related natural compounds were identified via network proximity and gene enrichment analyses. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed the therapeutic potential of purpurin for AD treatment, laying the foundation for further in-depth research and providing valuable information for the development of novel anti-AD drugs. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
  "39349220": "Alzheimer's disease, a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, is characterized by the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, triggering oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Current therapies focus on symptomatic treatment rather than targeting the underlying disease-modifying molecular mechanisms and are often associated with significant side effects. Bacopa monnieri, a traditional Indian herb with nootropic properties, has shown promise in neurological disorder treatment from ancient times. However, its mechanisms of action in Alzheimer's disease remain elusive. In this study, a cellular model for Alzheimer's disease was created by treating differentiated IMR-32 cells with beta-amyloid, 1-42 peptide (Aβ42). Additionally, a recovery model was established through co-treatment with Bacopa monnieri to explore its protective mechanism. Co-treatment with Bacopa monnieri extract recovered Aβ42 induced damage as evidenced by the decreased apoptosis and reduced reactive oxygen species production. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis identified 21,674 peptides, corresponding to 3626 proteins from the Alzheimer's disease model. The proteins dysregulated by Aβ42 were implicated in cellular functions, such as negative regulation of cell proliferation and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. The enriched pathways include extracellular matrix organization and interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling. Bacopa monnieri co-treatment showed remarkable restoration of Aβ42 altered proteins, including FOSL1, and TDO2. The protein-protein interaction network analysis of Bacopa monnieri restored proteins identified the hub gene involved in Alzheimer's disease. The findings from this study may open up new avenues for creating innovative therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease.",
  "39342323": "Microglia-driven neuroinflammation plays an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Microglia activation is accompanied by the formation and chronic expression of TLR4 inflammarafts, defined as enlarged and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts serving as an assembly platform for TLR4 dimers and complexes of other inflammatory receptors. The secreted apoA-I binding protein (APOA1BP or AIBP) binds TLR4 and selectively targets cholesterol depletion machinery to TLR4 inflammaraft-expressing inflammatory, but not homeostatic microglia. Here we demonstrated that amyloid-beta (Aβ) induced formation of TLR4 inflammarafts in microglia in vitro and in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. Mitochondria in Apoa1bp-/- APP/PS1 microglia were hyperbranched and cupped, which was accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species and the dilated endoplasmic reticulum. The size and number of Aβ plaques and neuronal cell death were significantly increased, and the animal survival was decreased in Apoa1bp-/-APP/PS1 compared to APP/PS1 female mice. These results suggest that AIBP exerts control of TLR4 inflammarafts and mitochondrial dynamics in microglia and plays a protective role in Alzheimer's disease associated oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. © 2024.

  "39340452": "Tau, an intrinsically disordered neuronal protein and polyampholyte with an overall positive charge, is a microtubule (MT) associated protein that binds to anionic domains of MTs and suppresses their dynamic instability. Aberrant tau-MT interactions are implicated in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we studied the interactions between full-length human protein tau and other negatively charged binding substrates, as revealed by differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy. As a binding substrate, we chose anionic liposomes (ALs) containing either 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (DOPS, -1e) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG, -1e) mixed with zwitterionic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) to mimic anionic plasma membranes of axons where tau resides. At low salt concentrations (0 to 10 mM KCl or NaCl) with minimal charge screening, reaction mixtures of tau and ALs resulted in the formation of distinct states of AL-tau complexes coexisting with liquid-liquid phase-separated tau self-coacervates arising from the polyampholytic nature of tau containing cationic and anionic domains. AL-tau complexes (i.e. tau-lipoplexes) exhibited distinct types of morphologies. This included large ∼20-30 μm tau-decorated giant vesicles with additional smaller liposomes with bound tau attached to the giant vesicles and tau-mediated finite-size assemblies of small liposomes. As the salt concentration was increased to near and above 150 mM for 1:1 electrolytes, AL-tau complexes remained stable, while tau self-coacervate droplets were found to dissolve, indicative of the breaking of (anionic/cationic) electrostatic bonds between tau chains due to increased charge screening. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that distinct cationic domains of tau may interact with anionic lipid domains of the lumen-facing monolayer of the axon's plasma membrane, suggesting the possibility of transient yet robust interactions near relevant ionic strengths found in neurons.",
  "39327003": "Systemic study of pathogenic pathways and interrelationships underlying genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) facilitates the identification of new targets for effective treatments. Recently available large-scale multiomics datasets provide opportunities to use computational approaches for such studies. Here, we devised a novel disease gene identification (digID) computational framework that consists of a semi-supervised deep learning classifier to predict AD-associated genes and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network-based analysis to prioritize the importance of these predicted genes in AD. digID predicted 1,529 AD-associated genes and revealed potentially new AD molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets including GNAI1 and GNB1, two G-protein subunits that regulate cell signaling, and KNG1, an upstream modulator of CDC42 small G-protein signaling and mediator of inflammation and candidate coregulator of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Analysis of mRNA expression validated their dysregulation in AD brains but further revealed the significant spatial patterns in different brain regions as well as among different subregions of the frontal cortex and hippocampi. Super-resolution STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) further demonstrated their subcellular colocalization and molecular interactions with APP in a transgenic mouse model of both sexes with AD-like mutations. These studies support the predictions made by digID while highlighting the importance of concurrent biological validation of computationally identified gene clusters as potential new AD therapeutic targets.",

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been proven to be tightly linked to AD. This project attempted to identify hub genes for AD based on NETs. Gene expression profiles of the training set and validation set were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including non-demented (ND) controls and AD samples. NET-related genes (NETRGs) were collected from the literature. Differential analysis identified 21 AD differentially expressed NETRGs (AD-DE-NETRGs) majorly linked to functions such as defense response to bacterium as well as pathways including IL-17 signaling pathway, as evidenced by enrichment analyses of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

Their diagnostic ability was validated in the validation set using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and gene differential expression analysis. A total of 16 miRNAs and 132 lncRNAs were predicted through the mirDIP and ENCORI databases, and a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software.

METHODS: The pharmacodynamic basis and mechanism of action between Amaryllidaceae alkaloids and Alzheimer's disease were explored by constructing a compound-target-disease network, targets protein-protein interaction, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and molecular docking verification. KEY FINDINGS: In total, a chemical library of 357 potential alkaloids was constructed. A total of 100 active alkaloid components were identified. Thirty-nine associated targets were yielded based on network construction, and the key targets were defined as HSP90AA1, ESR1, NOS3, PTGS2, and PPARG using protein-protein interaction network. Gene ontology items (490) and 68 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were selected through the enrichment of target functions, including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, Alzheimer disease, and serotonergic synapse that were related to Alzheimer's disease. Lastly, molecular docking demonstrated good stability in combining selected alkaloids with targets.

  "39306020": "Increased astrocytic lactoferrin (Lf) expression was observed in the brains of elderly individuals and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Our previous study revealed that astrocytic Lf overexpression improved cognitive capacity by facilitating Lf secretion to neurons to inhibit β-amyloid protein (Aβ) production in APP/PS1 mice. Here, we further discovered that astrocytic Lf overexpression inhibited neuronal loss by decreasing iron accumulation and increasing glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression in neurons within APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, human Lf (hLf) treatment inhibited ammonium ferric citrate (FAC)-induced ferroptosis by chelating intracellular iron. Additionally, machine learning analysis uncovered a correlation between Lf and GPX4. hLf treatment boosted low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) internalization and facilitated its interaction with heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), thereby inhibiting HSC70 binds to GPX4, and eventually attenuating GPX4 degradation and FAC-induced ferroptosis. Overall, astrocytic Lf overexpression inhibited neuronal ferroptosis through two pathways: reducing intracellular iron accumulation and promoting GPX4 expression via inhibiting chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-mediated GPX4 degradation. Hence, upregulating astrocytic Lf expression is a promising strategy for combating AD.",
  "39268577": "RTP801/REDD1 is a stress-responsive protein overexpressed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that contributes to cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation. Here, we found that RTP801 interacts with HSPC117, DDX1 and CGI-99, three members of the tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC), which ligates the excised exons of intron-containing tRNAs and the mRNA exons of the transcription factor XBP1 during the unfolded protein response (UPR). We also found that RTP801 modulates the mRNA ligase activity of the complex in vitro since RTP801 knockdown promoted XBP1 splicing and the expression of its transcriptional target, SEC24D. Conversely, RTP801 overexpression inhibited the splicing of XBP1. Similarly, in human AD postmortem hippocampal samples, where RTP801 is upregulated, we found that XBP1 splicing was dramatically decreased. In the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, silencing RTP801 expression in hippocampal neurons promoted Xbp1 splicing and prevented the accumulation of intron-containing pre-tRNAs. Finally, the tRNA-enriched fraction obtained from 5xFAD mice promoted abnormal dendritic arborization in cultured hippocampal neurons, and RTP801 silencing in the source neurons prevented this phenotype. Altogether, these results show that elevated RTP801 impairs RNA processing in vitro and in vivo in the context of AD and suggest that RTP801 inhibition could be a promising therapeutic approach. © The Author(s) 2024.

  "39261388": "The most common cause of dementia among elderly people is Alzheimer's disease (AD). The typical symptom of AD is the decline of cognitive abilities, which is caused by loss of synaptic function. Amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers play a significant role in the development of this synaptic dysfunction. Neuroligin-(NL)1 is a postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule located in excitatory synapses and involved in the maintenance and modulation of synaptic contacts. A recent study has found that Aβ interacts with the soluble N-terminal fragment of NL1. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of NL1 in Aβ-induced neuropathology. Employing surface plasmon resonance and competitive ELISA, we confirmed the high-affinity binding of NL1 to the Aβ peptide. We also identified a sequence motif representing the NL1-binding site for the Aβ peptide and showed that a synthetic peptide modeled after this motif, termed neurolide, binds to the Aβ peptide with high affinity, comparable to the NL1-Aβ interaction. To assess the effect of neurolide in vivo, wild-type and 5XFAD mice were subcutaneously treated with this peptide for 10 weeks. We observed an increase in Aβ plaque formation in the cortex of neurolide-treated 5XFAD mice. Furthermore, we showed that neurolide reduces the activity of neprilysin, the predominant Aβ-degrading enzyme in the brain. Accordingly, we suggest that neurolide is the NL1-binding site for Aβ peptide, and acts as an inhibitor of neprilysin activity. Based on these data, we confirm the involvement of NL1 in the development of AD and suggest a mechanism for NL1-induced Aβ plaque formation. © 2024. The Author(s).",
  "39260276": "Tau is a protein found in the central nervous system (CNS) and is involved in stabilizing microtubules in axons. Given the link between Tau levels in the body and Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a demand for straightforward and precise strategies to detect Tau in body fluids. In this study, we report liquid crystal (LC)-based sensors for the real-time detection of Tau protein, a well-known AD biomarker. The sensor uses a detection method based on the orientation change of the LC because of the competitive biomolecular interaction between Tau and Tau aptamers with the cationic polymer poly-L-lysine (PLL). Tau and its aptamers form stable complexes through electrostatic interactions. Owing to the consumption of the aptamer, the positively charged PLL fails to interact with the aptamer but binds to the negatively charged 1.2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) sodium salt (DOPG). The PLL and DOPG complex alters the orientation of the LC to ensure a planar anchoring of the 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB)/aqueous interface; this anchoring intensifies with increasing Tau concentration, thus enabling the observation of a bright optical image. Our LC-based sensor demonstrated a low detection limit of 2.77 pg/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 10.86 pg/mL and 19.31 pg/mL in human serum and plasma, respectively. Moreover, it is anticipated to be suitable for point-of-care diagnosis of AD because it does not require specialized analytical equipment and only requires microliters of sample.",
  "39259503": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common aetiology of dementia. The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) induces the expression of genes encoding phase II detoxification and antioxidant genes. NRF2 is regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), and the KEAP1-NRF2 system is the key regulatory system involved in cytoprotection. To examine whether pharmacological induction of NRF2 expression alleviates AD phenotypes in vivo, we employed two AD mouse models, i.e. App NL-G-F/NL-G-F (AppNLGF) and APPV717I::TAUP301L (APP/TAU) mice. As the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid 1-[2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11-dien-28-oyl)] (CDDO)-4(-pyridin-2-yl)-imidazole (CDDO-2P-Im) exhibits strong NRF2-inducing activity, we treated AD model mice with CDDO-2P-Im. We found that Aβ42 levels were markedly greater in the brains of AppNLGF mice than in those of APP/TAU mice. CDDO-2P-Im treatment significantly decreased Aβ42 levels, but not Aβ40 levels, in APP/TAU mice. Consequently, CDDO-2P-Im also decreased the ratio of Aβ42/Aβ40, a vital marker of amyloid plaque formation. LC-MS/MS analyses revealed that CDDO-2P-Im was delivered to the brains of the APP/TAU mice. CDDO-2P-Im induced the expression of detoxification and antioxidant gene targets of NRF2 and elevated reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in the mouse brain.

The development cohort, consisting of 35,547 participants from England in the UK Biobank, was randomly divided into a 7:3 training-testing ratio. The validation cohort included 4667 participants from Scotland and Wales in the UK Biobank. In the training set, an AD protein risk score was constructed using 31 proteins out of 2911 proteins. In the testing set, the AD protein risk score had a C-index of 0.867 (95% CI, 0.828, 0.906) for AD prediction, followed by CogDrisk-AD risk factors (C-index, 0.856; 95% CI, 0.823, 0.889), and APOE genotypes (C-index, 0.705; 95% CI, 0.660, 0.750). Adding the AD protein risk score to CogDrisk-AD risk factors (C-index increase, 0.050; 95% CI, 0.008, 0.093) significantly improved the predictive performance for AD. However, adding CogDrisk-AD risk factors (C-index increase, 0.040; 95% CI, -0.007, 0.086) or APOE genotypes (C-index increase, 0.000; 95% CI, -0.054, 0.055) to the AD protein risk score did not significantly improve the predictive performance for AD. The top 10 proteins with the highest coefficients in the AD protein risk score contributed most of the predictive power for AD risk. These results were verified in the external validation cohort. EGFR, GFAP, and CHGA were identified as key proteins within the protein network. Our result suggests that the AD protein risk score demonstrated a good predictive performance for AD risk. © 2024 The Author(s).

Up to date, there are no effective therapies available. The need for innovative treatments for this illness is critical. We found that minocycline (MC, 5 μM) was innocuous toward wild-type (WT) PSEN1 ChLNs but significantly (i) reduces the accumulation of intracellular Aβ by -69%, (ii) blocks both abnormal phosphorylation of the protein TAU at residue Ser202/Thr205 by -33% and (iii) phosphorylation of the proapoptotic transcription factor c-JUN at residue Ser63/Ser73 by -25%, (iv) diminishes oxidized DJ-1 at Cys106-SO3 by -29%, (v) downregulates the expression of transcription factor TP53, (vi) BH-3-only protein PUMA, and (vii) cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) by -33, -86, and -78%, respectively, compared with untreated PSEN1 E280A ChLNs. Additionally, MC increases the response to ACh-induced Ca2+ influx by +92% in mutant ChLNs. Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) analysis showed that MC might operate more efficiently as a hydrogen atom transfer agent than a single electron transfer agent. In silico molecular docking analysis predicts that MC binds with high affinity to Aβ (Vina Score -6.6 kcal/mol), TAU (VS -6.5 kcal/mol), and caspase 3 (VS -7.1 kcal/mol). Taken together, our findings suggest that MC demonstrates antioxidant, anti-amyloid, and anti-apoptosis activity and promotes physiological ACh-induced Ca2+ influx in PSEN1 E280A ChLNs. The MC has therapeutic potential for treating early-onset FAD.",
  "39212313": "INTRODUCTION: Cellular prion protein (PrPC) was implicated in amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the precise molecular mechanisms involved in this process are unclear. METHODS: Double transgenic mice were generated by crossing Prnp knockout (KO) with 5xFAD mice, and light-sheet microscopy was used for whole brain tissue analyses. PrPC-overexpressing cells were developed for in vitro studies, and microscopy was used to assess co-localization of proteins of interest. Surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to investigate protein-binding characteristics. RESULTS: In vivo, PrPC levels correlated with reduced lifespan and cognitive and motor function, and its ablation disconnected behavior deficits from Aβ levels. Light-sheet microscopy showed that PrPC influenced Aβ-plaque burden but not the distribution of those plaques. Interestingly, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) KO neurons significantly reduced intracellular Aβ-oligomer (Aβo) uptake when compared to wild-type neurons. DISCUSSION: The findings shed new light on the relevance of intracellular Aβo, suggesting that PrPC and Cav-1 modulate intracellular Aβ levels and the Aβ-plaque load. HIGHLIGHTS: PrPC expression adversely affects lifespan and behavior in 5xFAD mice. PrPC increases Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels and Aβ-plaque load in 5xFAD mice. Cav-1 interacts with both PrPC and Aβ peptides. Knocking out Cav-1 leads to a significant reduction in intracellular Aβ levels. © 2024 The Author(s).

  "39206808": "Suppressor of Mek1 (Smek1) is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 4. Genome-wide association studies have shown the protective effect of SMEK1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological and pathological roles of Smek1 in AD and other tauopathies are largely unclear. Here, the role of Smek1 in preventing neurodegeneration is investigated in tauopathy. Smek1 is downregulated in the aged human brain. Through single-cell sequencing, a novel neuronal cluster is identified that possesses neurodegenerative characteristics in Smek1-/- mice. Smek1 deficiency caused markedly more severe motor and cognitive impairments in mice, as well as neuronal loss, gliosis, and tau hyperphosphorylation at major glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk3β) sites. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that the Ran-binding domain (RanBD) in the N-terminus of Smek1 facilitated binding with kinesin family member 2A (Kif2a). Depletion of Smek1 resulted in cytoplasmic aggregation of Kif2a, axon outgrowth defects, and impaired mitochondrial axonal trafficking. Downregulation of Kif2a markedly attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation and axon outgrowth defects in shSmek1 cells. For the first time, this study demonstrates that Smek1 deficiency progressively induces neurodegeneration by exacerbating tau pathology and mitochondrial dysfunction in an age-dependent manner. © 2024 The Author(s).

  "39136807": "Dysfunctional lactate metabolism in the brain has been implicated in neuroinflammation, Aβ deposition, and cell disturbance, all of which play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) in AD via an integrated bulk RNA and single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis, with a specific focus on microglia. We obtained 26 HC and 24 AD snRNA-seq samples originated from human prefrontal cortex in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and collected 873 LMRGs from three databases, namely MSigDB, The Human Protein Atlas and GeneCards. Bulk RNA was analyzed with LMRG characteristics in AD by using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the protein-protein interaction (PPI), CytoHubba-MCC, Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms analyses. Then we conducted the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, correlation, and connection network analyses for biomarkers. Their differential expression validation was performed using AlzData database. The single-nuclei RNA analysis of microglia was applied to identify hub genes and pathways using cell-cell communication analysis and high dimensional Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (hdWGCNA). Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm showed an AUC of 0.967, a sensitivity of 93.30% and a specificity of 100.00%. Our analysis identified biomarkers with LMRG characteristics, namely INSR, CDKL1, and PNISR. ROC analysis revealed that each of these biomarkers exhibited excellent diagnostic potential, as evidenced by their respective area under the curve (AUC) values: INSR (AUC: 0.679), CDKL1 (AUC: 0.788), and PNISR (AUC: 0.724). Correlation analysis showed that biomarkers exhibited a positive correlation with each other. Connection network illustrated their shared biological processes: aging, phosphorylation, metabolic process, and apoptosis. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed that GALECTIN signaling pathway was exclusively expressed in AD microglia, and only LGALS9 exhibited significant overexpression. HdWGCNA identified FTH1 as a hub gene enriched in ferroptosis and mineral absorption pathways within microglia. The roles of INSR, CDKL1, PNISR, LGALS9, and FTH1 should be taken into account to enhance our understanding of lactate metabolism in the context of AD. © 2024.

  "39134826": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. Evidence shows that depression is a common co-occurrence in AD patients, and major depressive disorder (MDD) is considered a risk factor for AD. The crosstalk between the biological procedures related to the two disorders makes it very difficult to treat the comorbid conditions caused by them. Considering the common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD and MDD, antidepressant drugs may have beneficial therapeutic effects against their concurrence. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential drug candidates for the prevention and treatment of the comorbidity of AD and MDD. First, we screened the potential drugs for treating MDD by evaluating the distances of drug targets to MDD-related genes on the human protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) via a network-based algorithm. Then, the drugs were further screened to identify those that may be effective for AD treatment by analyzing their affinities with tau protein and Aβ42 peptide via molecular docking. Furthermore, the most stable binding modes were identified via molecular dynamics simulations, and the regulatory effects of drug candidates on genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD and MDD were analyzed. A total of 506 MDD-related genes were retrieved, and 831 drug candidates for MDD treatment were screened via the network-based approach. The results from molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated dihydroergotamine had the lowest binding affinity with tau protein and bromocriptine could form the most stable binding mode with Aβ42 peptide. Further analyses found that both dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine could regulate the expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD and/or MDD in the brain. The exact mechanisms of the two drugs in treating AD and MDD, as well as their comorbidity, are still unclear, and further exploration is needed to evaluate their roles and mechanisms, both in vitro and in vivo. This study revealed that dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine may be the potential drug candidates for the treatment of the comorbidity of AD and MDD, and the therapeutic effects may be achieved by inhibiting the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ42 and tau protein and regulating the expression of disease-related genes in the brain. © 2024.

HMGB1 promotes inflammation during sterile and infectious damage and plays a crucial role in disease development. Mobilization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is the first important step in the release of HMGB1 from activated immune cells. Here, we demonstrated that Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) physically interacts with and deacetylates HMGB1 at 43 lysine residue at nuclear localization signal locations, strengthening its interaction with HMGB1 and causing HMGB1 to be localized in the cytoplasm.

  "39074206": "The microtubule-associated protein Tau is a driver of neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. In this process, Tau initially undergoes subtle changes to its abundance, subcellular localization and a vast array of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation that progressively result in the protein's somatodendritic accumulation and dysregulation of multiple Tau-dependent cellular processes. Given the various loss- and gain-of-functions of Tau in disease and the brain-wide changes in the proteome that characterize tauopathies, we asked whether targeting Tau would restore the alterations in proteostasis observed in disease. Therefore, by phage display, we generated a novel pan-Tau antibody, RNJ1, that preferentially binds human Tau and neutralizes proteopathic seeding activity in multiple cell lines and benchmarked it against a clinically tested pan-Tau antibody, HJ8.5 (murine version of tilavonemab). We then evaluated both antibodies, alone and in combination, in the K3 tauopathy mouse model, showing reduced Tau pathology and improvements in neuronal function following 14 weekly treatments, without obtaining synergy for the combination. These effects were more pronounced in female mice. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to improvements in neuronal function, we employed quantitative proteomics, phosphoproteomics and kinase prediction analysis to first establish alterations in K3 mice relative to wild-type controls at the proteome level. In female K3 mice, we found 342 differentially abundant proteins, which are predominantly involved in metabolic and microtubule-associated processes, strengthening previously reported findings of defects in several functional domains in multiple tauopathy models. We next asked whether antibody-mediated Tau target engagement indirectly affects levels of deregulated proteins in the K3 model. Importantly, both immunotherapies, in particular RNJ1, induced abundance shifts towards a restoration to wild-type levels (proteostasis). A total of 257 of 342 (∼75%) proteins altered in K3 were closer in abundance to wild-type levels after RNJ1 treatment, and 73% after HJ8.5 treatment. However, the magnitude of these changes was less pronounced than that observed with RNJ1. Furthermore, analysis of the phosphoproteome showed an even stronger restoration effect with RNJ1, with ∼82% of altered phosphopeptides in K3 showing a shift to wild-type levels, and 75% with HJ8.5. Gene set over-representation analysis further confirmed that proteins undergoing restoration are involved in biological pathways affected in K3 mice. Together, our study suggests that a Tau immunotherapy-induced restoration of proteostasis links target engagement and treatment efficacy. © The Author(s) 2024.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the active ingredients of HUANGQI and its potential targets and mechanisms of action in AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active ingredients and targets of HUANGQI were screened from databases (TCSMP, ETCM, and BATMan), and AD-related genes were obtained from DrugBank and GeneCards. The same target genes were screened, and a drug-target disease network was constructed. The PPI network was constructed and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of the targets. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine suitable HUANGQI treatment concentrations for HT-22 cells between 0-480 μg/mL. CCK-8, FITC-phalloidin and propidium iodide (PI) assays were used to examine the protective effect of (0, 60, 120, 240 μg/mL) of HUANGQI on 20 μM Aβ1-42-induced HT-22 cell cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Twelve active ingredients of HUANGQI were selected, with 679 common targets associated with AD. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that the therapeutic mechanisms of HUANGQI involve TNF, AGE, the NF-κB pathway, and nuclear receptor activity-related processes. The CCK-8 assay indicated that HUANGQI was not cytotoxic to HT-22 cells at concentrations less than 240 μg/mL and was able to attenuate Aβ1-42-induced cellular damage (EC50 = 83.46 μg/mL). FITC-phalloidin and PI assays suggested that HUANGQI could alleviate 20 μM Aβ1-42-induced neuronal cell cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner.

Synthetically designed small molecules/ peptides/ peptidomimetics show promise towards inhibition of various kinds of amyloidosis. However, exploration of compounds isolated from natural extracts having such potential is lacking. Herein, we have investigated the repurposing of a traditional Indian medicine Lasunadya Ghrita (LG) in AD. LG is traditionally used to treat gut dysregulation and mental illnesses. Various extracts of LG were obtained, characterized, and analyzed for inhibition of Aβ aggregation. Biophysical studies show that the water extract of LG (LGWE) is more potent in inhibiting Aβ peptide aggregation and defibrillation of Aβ40/Aβ42 aggregates. NMR studies showed that LGWE binds to the central hydrophobic area and C-terminal residues of Aβ40/Aβ42, thereby modulating the aggregation, and reducing cell membrane damage. Additionally, LGWE rescues Aβ toxicity in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells evident from decreases in ROS generation, membrane leakage, cellular apoptosis, and calcium dyshomeostasis. Notably, LGWE is non-toxic to neuronal cells and mouse models. Our study thus delves into the mechanistic insights of a repurposed drug LGWE with the potential to ameliorate Aβ induced neuroinflammation.",
  "39009412": "Treatments for Alzheimer's disease have primarily focused on removing brain amyloid plaques to improve cognitive outcomes in patients. We developed small compounds, known as BK40143 and BK40197, and we hypothesize that these drugs alleviate microglial-mediated neuroinflammation and induce autophagic clearance of neurotoxic proteins to improve behavior in models of neurodegeneration. Specificity binding assays of BK40143 and BK40197 showed primary binding to c-KIT/Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptors (PDGFR)α/β, whereas BK40197 also differentially binds to FYVE finger-containing phosphoinositide kinase (PIKFYVE). Both compounds penetrate the CNS, and treatment with these drugs inhibited the maturation of peripheral mast cells in transgenic mice, correlating with cognitive improvements on measures of memory and anxiety. In the brain, microglial activation was profoundly attenuated and amyloid-beta and tau were reduced via autophagy.

  "39004381": "BACKGROUND: The growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (Gadd45) gene has been implicated in various central nervous system (CNS) functions, both normal and pathological, including aging, memory, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined whether Gadd45A deletion triggers pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Utilizing transcriptome data from AD-associated hippocampus samples, we identified Gadd45A as a pivotal regulator of autophagy. Comprehensive analyses, including Gene Ontology enrichment and protein-protein interaction network assessments, highlighted Cdkn1A as a significant downstream target of Gadd45A. Experimental validation confirmed Gadd45A's role in modulating Cdkn1A expression and autophagy levels in hippocampal cells. We also examined the effects of autophagy on hippocampal functions and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Additionally, a murine model was employed to validate the importance of Gadd45A in neuroinflammation and AD pathology. RESULTS: Our study identified 20 autophagy regulatory factors associated with AD, with Gadd45A emerging as a critical regulator. Experimental findings demonstrated that Gadd45A influences hippocampal cell fate by reducing Cdkn1A expression and suppressing autophagic activity. Comparisons between wild-type (WT) and Gadd45A knockout (Gadd45A-/-) mice revealed that Gadd45A-/- mice exhibited significant cognitive impairments, including deficits in working and spatial memory, increased Tau hyperphosphorylation, and elevated levels of kinases involved in Tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Additionally, Gadd45A-/- mice showed significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreases autophagy markers in the brain. Neurotrophin levels and dendritic spine length were also reduced in Gadd45A-/- mice, likely contributing to the observed cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the direct involvement of the Gadd45A gene in AD pathogenesis, and enhancing the expression of Gadd45A may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.",
  "38994634": "Amyloid plaques, a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are caused by an imbalance between the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways of amyloid precursor protein (APP). BACE1 cleavage of APP is the rate-limiting step for amyloid-β production and plaque formation in AD. Although the alteration of BACE1 expression in AD has been investigated, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we determined MEIS2 was notably elevated in AD models and AD patients. Alterations in the expression of MEIS2 can modulate the levels of BACE1. MEIS2 downregulation improved the learning and memory retention of AD mice and decreased the number of amyloid plaques. MEIS2 binds to the BACE1 promoter, positively regulates BACE1 expression, and accelerates APP amyloid degradation in vitro. Therefore, our findings suggest that MEIS2 might be a critical transcription factor in AD, since it regulates BACE1 expression and accelerates BACE1-mediated APP amyloidogenic cleavage.

  "38961225": "APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with increased odds ratios in female carriers. Targeting amyloid plaques shows modest improvement in male non-APOE4 carriers. Leveraging single-cell transcriptomics across APOE variants in both sexes, multiplex flow cytometry and validation in two independent cohorts of APOE4 female carriers with AD, we identify a new subset of neutrophils interacting with microglia associated with cognitive impairment. This phenotype is defined by increased interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-1 coexpressed gene modules in blood neutrophils and in microglia of cognitively impaired female APOE ε4 carriers, showing increased infiltration to the AD brain. APOE4 female IL-17+ neutrophils upregulated the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGFβ and immune checkpoints, including LAG3 and PD-1, associated with accelerated immune aging. Deletion of APOE4 in neutrophils reduced this immunosuppressive phenotype and restored the microglial response to neurodegeneration, limiting plaque pathology in AD mice. Mechanistically, IL-17F upregulated in APOE4 neutrophils interacts with microglial IL-17RA to suppress the induction of the neurodegenerative phenotype, and blocking this axis supported cognitive improvement in AD mice.

By using GREAT software, we identified regulatory functions of top lncRNAs in different neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, lncRNAs cis-regulated mRNAs linked to neurodegeneration, including JAK2, AKT1, EGFR, CDC42, SNCA, and ADIPOQ, highlighting their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases. A further exploration into the differential expression of mRNA identified by PCDLnc revealed a role in apoptosis, ferroptosis and autophagy. Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis exposed abnormal interactions among key genes, despite their consistent expression levels between disease and normal samples. The randomforest model effectively distinguished between disease samples, indicating a high level of accuracy. Shared gene subsets in AD and PD might serve as potential biomarkers, along with disease-specific gene sets. Besides, we also found the strong relationship between AD and immune infiltration.

The transcriptome data of brain tissue in AD patients were screened from the GEO database, and pyroptosis-related genes were analyzed. The functions of differential genes were analyzed by enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction. The diagnostic model was established using LASSO and logistic regression analysis, and the correlation of clinical data was analyzed. Based on single-cell analysis of brain tissues of patients with AD, immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to explore the key cells affected by the hub gene. After GSEA, qRT-PCR, western blotting, LDH, ROS, and JC-1 were used to investigate the potential mechanism of the hub gene on pyroptosis. A total of 15 pyroptosis differentially expressed genes were identified. A prediction model consisting of six genes was established by LASSO and logistic regression analysis, and the area under the curve was up to 0.81. As a hub gene, CHMP4B was negatively correlated with the severity of AD. CHMP4B expression was decreased in the hippocampal tissue of patients with AD and mice. Single-cell analysis showed that CHMP4B was downregulated in AD microglia. Overexpression of CHMP4B reduced the release of LDH and ROS and restored mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response during microglial pyroptosis. In summary, CHMP4B as a hub gene provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. © 2024.

RNA binding proteins (RBPs) containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are present in diverse molecular complexes where they function as dynamic regulators. Their characteristics promote liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the formation of membraneless organelles such as stress granules and nucleoli. IDR-RBPs are particularly relevant in the nervous system and their dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumor development. Serpine1 mRNA-binding protein 1 (SERBP1) is a unique member of this group, being mostly disordered and lacking canonical RNA-binding domains. We defined SERBP1's interactome, uncovered novel roles in splicing, cell division and ribosomal biogenesis, and showed its participation in pathological stress granules and Tau aggregates in Alzheimer's brains. SERBP1 preferentially interacts with other G-quadruplex (G4) binders, implicated in different stages of gene expression, suggesting that G4 binding is a critical component of SERBP1 function in different settings. Similarly, we identified important associations between SERBP1 and PARP1/polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation). SERBP1 interacts with PARP1 and its associated factors and influences PARylation. Moreover, protein complexes in which SERBP1 participates contain mostly PARylated proteins and PAR binders. Based on these results, we propose a feedback regulatory model in which SERBP1 influences PARP1 function and PARylation, while PARylation modulates SERBP1 functions and participation in regulatory complexes.",

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) have been identified as being involved in the pathological hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and causes Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this study was conducted to confirm the traditional claims by detection of active compounds, namely curcumin, gallic acid, catechin, rosmarinic acid, and andrographolide in the raw materials of Honey-iQfood through HPLC analysis, molecular docking, and dynamic simulations. Two potential compounds, andrographolide, and rosmarinic acid, produced the best binding affinities following the molecular docking of the active compounds against the GSK-3β and CDK5 targets. Andrographolide binds with GSK-3β at -8.2 kcal/mol, whereas rosmarinic acid binds to CDK5 targets at -8.6 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics was further carried out to confirm the docking results and clarify their dynamic properties such as RMSD, RMSF, rGyr, SASA, PSA, and binding free energy. CDK5-andrographolide complexes had the best MM-GBSA score (-83.63 kcal/mol) compared to other complexes, indicating the better interaction profile and stability of the complex. These findings warrant further research into andrographolide and rosmarinic acid as efficient inhibitors of tau protein hyperphosphorylation to verify their therapeutic potential in brain-related illnesses.",

Amyloid beta (Aβ)- accumulating macromolecules in the brain are the primary cause of the disease's chronic symptoms, according to analysis carried out during the last 20 years. Plaques and clumps of amyloid- build up in the brain, obstructing neuronal signals and destroying neural connections. Tau, a protein that results in the formation of \"neurofibrillary tangles\" in the brain, another hallmark of neuronal death, has been the focus of a lot of research. Dendrimers Delivery (DDs) is one of the most promising advancements in nanotechnology for biomedical applications, particularly drug delivery. Some of the main categories of dendrimers employed in the successful management of neurodegenerative illnesses are polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM) dendrimers, polypropylenimine dendrimers (PPI), Poly-l-lysine dendrimers (PLL), and carbosilane dendrimers. The tight blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the entry of medications or therapeutic agents, makes it difficult to treat central nervous system disorders. Dendrimers have attracted the attention of scientists more than other non-invasive methods of drug delivery across the BBB and improve the uptake of medicines in the brain's target tissues. The major benefits of dendrimers include their adaptability, biocompatibility, ability to load pharmaceuticals into the core and surface, and nanosize. The patents provide \"composition of matter\" protection for Starpharma's dendrimer technologies for drug delivery out to 2029 in the United States, which is the world's largest pharmaceutical market for several important drug classes. This review has updated the status of the patent and clinical trials literature pertaining to dendrimer use in AD.",
  "37643074": "The multifaceted interplay between neurodegenerative pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the highly virulent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is implicated in various conditions. AD and SARS-CoV pathogenesis involve the APOE4 allele, NLRP3 inflammasome, and ACE2-SPIKE complex. APOE4, a genetic polymorphism of the APOE gene, is associated with an increased susceptibility to AD. NLRP3, an inflammatory protein of the innate immune system, plays a pivotal role in immune response cascades. In SARS-CoV, the ACE2 receptor serves as the principal portal for cellular entry, while APOE4 intricately interacts with the ACE2-spike protein complex, enhancing viral internalization process. The interaction of NLRP3 with the ACE2-spike protein complex leads to increased inflammatory signaling. The convergence of APOE4/NLRP3 and ACE2-spike protein complex interactions suggests a possible link between SARS and AD. Therefore, the current research centralizes the association between by utilizing SARS-CoV datasets to explore possible mechanisms that account for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and AD. The work is further extended to unveil the molecular interactions of APOE4 and NLRP3 with the ACE2-Spike protein complex at the molecular level by employing molecular dynamics simulation techniques. The therapeutic efficacy of Chyawanprash nutraceuticals is evaluated as their inhibitory potential towards APOE4-ACE2-Spike protein and NLRP3-ACE2-Spike protein complexes. Notably, our simulations unequivocally demonstrate the robust and enduring binding capability of the compound Phyllantidine with the target complexes throughout the simulation period. The findings of the studies further corroborate the primary hypothesis of APOE4 and NLRP3 as driver factors in the pathogenesis of both SARS-CoV and AD. Therefore, this research establishes a paradigm for comprehending the complex interaction between AD and SARS-CoV and lays the groundwork for further study in this domain.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

  "37530227": "Before the controversial approval of humanized monoclonal antibody lecanemab, which binds to the soluble amyloid-β protofibrils, all the treatments available earlier, for Alzheimer's disease (AD) were symptomatic. The researchers are still struggling to find a breakthrough in AD therapeutic medicine, which is partially attributable to lack in understanding of the structural information associated with the intrinsically disordered proteins and amyloids. One of the major challenges in this area of research is to understand the structural diversity of intrinsically disordered proteins under in vitro conditions. Therefore, in this review, we have summarized the in vitro applications of biophysical methods, which are aimed to shed some light on the heterogeneity, pathogenicity, structures and mechanisms of the intrinsically disordered protein aggregates associated with proteinopathies including AD. This review will also rationalize some of the strategies in modulating disease-relevant pathogenic protein entities by small molecules using structural biology approaches and biophysical characterization. We have also highlighted tools and techniques to simulate the in vivo conditions for native and cytotoxic tau/amyloids assemblies, urge new chemical approaches to replicate tau/amyloids assemblies similar to those in vivo conditions, in addition to designing novel potential drugs. © 2023 The Authors.
